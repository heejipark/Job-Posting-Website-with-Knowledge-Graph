    myns:description "Auto-Owners Insurance is the largest property and casualty insurance company domiciled in Michigan. Auto-Owners success can be traced back from its present management to the early leadership of Vern V. Moulton who, in 1916, organized Auto-Owners Insurance Company in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. The infant Company had no capital and was housed in one room of a bank building. Auto-Owners operated in Mt. Pleasant for a little less than a year. In 1917, V.V. Moulton literally picked the Company up, placed it under his arm and in his pocket (the Company consisted of one book of policyholders' names and $174.25 in assets), and moved Auto-Owners to Lansing, Michigan.It wasn't long before the Depression began, and Auto-Owners weathered even the lowest point of that era - the bank holidays of February 1933. The Company demonstrated its corporate toughness and financial stability by paying all claims promptly, daily, and IN CASH! The firm was then writing more than $2.5 million in insurance premiums.Auto-Owners entered the general casualty insurance field in 1940, having previously written only automobile insurance. During the next five years, the Company found it necessary to acquire three more buildings in the vicinity of its main office to accommodate its continued growth. In 1951 it consolidated all of its offices into one home office, which was constructed in downtown Lansing." ;

    myns:description "In the 1990’s, the building materials industry changed significantly. Homebuilders grew by acquisition, creating large national competitors. Building materials manufacturers also consolidated. It was inevitable that the building material supply industry, the companies between the consolidating manufacturers and consolidating homebuilders, must consolidate as well. Builders FirstSource was born from this industry evolution.In March 1998, the Company’s management team, with the backing of JLL Partners, a private investment firm with significant committed capital, made its first acquisition. Builders FirstSource continued to grow through a combination of strategic acquisitions and internal expansion. Between 1998 and the beginning of 2015, we acquired and integrated thirty-three companies. In June 2005, Builders FirstSource completed an initial public offering of its common stock, after which JLL Partners maintained a significant investment in the company. On July 31, 2015, Builders FirstSource acquired its largest competitor, ProBuild Holdings LLC, creating a more diversified company with enhanced scale and improved geographic footprint. The combined company, on a pro forma basis, generated over $6 billion in annual revenue in 2015 and currently operates approximately 400 locations in 40 states, with a market presence in 74 of the top 100 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States.Builders FirstSource strives to be the preferred supplier of structural building materials and services to homebuilders and remodelers across the nation by giving them both personalized attention at the local level and a wide range of resources only offered by a large company. Builders FirstSource’s goal is to provide outstanding products and services to every customer, regardless of size." ;

The company’s local approach addresses the needs of under-insured and uninsured individuals who often lack the resources required to sustain optimal health and wellness. Centene began as a single health plan in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1984. After an initial period of growth, Michael Neidorff joined as President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in 1996, moving Centene’s headquarters to St. Louis, Missouri, where it still resides today.In the decades since its humble beginnings, Centene has transformed into a publicly-traded Fortune 500 company serving communities across the United States. In fact, Centene provides coverage in all 50 U.S. states. More than 26 million Americans rely on Centene to access a wide range of insurance solutions, including Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE, correctional, and behavioral health services. Centene prioritizes the development of technology that addresses systemic conditions impacting the whole health needs of underserved populations. As technology plays an increasingly critical role in diagnosing, managing, and treating disease, Centene understands that it enables better health outcomes for members, lessening the burden for providers, and allowing more automation and efficiency for business operations. As a steward of a significant set of data and insights, Centene leverages this data to not only shape but lead the digital transformation of healthcare and improve the patient-provider experience. Centene’s current CEO, Sarah London, and her team are leading the charge in this new age. Sarah London worked within Centene’s Technology Innovation and Modernization division, spearheading the company’s enterprise-wide technology strategy. Now leading Centene, her focus is on building the next generation of products and services and establishing Centene’s long-term growth and value creation. Although Centene has grown into the No. 1 insurer in the U.S. Health Insurance Marketplace, it has never lost its focus on the individual or its passion for community health. Remaining connected to the individuals and families that need care most is central to Centene’s commitment to shaping a better world of healthcare for the communities it serves. Centene also remains connected to the needs of its employees, who make Centene what it is. Through its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion practices, Centene promotes a safe and inviting environment above all. Because of Centene’s commitment to excellence and progression in the healthcare industry, it has been recognized as a Top Organization for Diversity by Modern Healthcare magazine, a Leading Disability Employer by the National Organization on Disability, a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality by The Human Rights Campaign Foundation, and a global leader by Bloomberg’s Gender-Equality Index, among many other recognitions. Centene was also named a Top 50 Company for Diversity by DiversityInc and a Top Veteran-Friendly Company by U.S. Veterans Magazine. It has also been listed on FORTUNE® magazine's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for several consecutive years." ;

An avid fisherman, Dick was approached by the store owner to come up with a list of products needed to get into the fishing tackle business. After Dick presented his suggestions, the owner told him he was a dumb kid and had no idea what he was doing. Dick was upset and promptly quit. He went to his grandmother’s house where he spent a lot of time as a kid and told her what had happened.Dick’s grandmother asked how much it would cost to build the store himself. Dick said it would cost $300. His grandmother then went to the cookie jar where she kept her life savings and gave him $300 and told him “do it yourself.” Dick used that money and his relentless work-ethic to open a bait-and-tackle shop in Binghamton. By 1958, he expanded his product line to include much of what you’ll find at DICK’S Sporting Goods today.Ed Stack, Dick’s son, is the current CEO and Chairman of DICK’S Sporting Goods. He and his siblings bought the store from their father and are responsible for taking two stores and growing the chain to over 500 stores.Dick’s family continues to offer the finest quality products at competitive prices, backed by the best service anywhere. Like you, they have a real passion for sports.Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. is an authentic full-line sporting goods retailer offering a broad assortment of brand name sporting goods equipment, apparel and footwear in a specialty store environment.

Since then, Reliance has completed more than 55 acquisitions and risen to become the largest metals service center in North America. Through a network of more than 300 locations in 39 states and twelve countries outside of the United States, the Company provides value-added metals processing services and distributes a full line of over 100,000 metal products to more than 125,000 customers in a broad range of industries.Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. is a Fortune 500 company and has been named to the Fortune list of “The World’s Most Admired Companies” since 2007. 75 years after their humble beginnings, they continue to celebrate, affirm, and encourage their core values, both in their business practices and their local communities, keeping their family of companies successful." ;
