['Ardent Ragle Solutions'],,Research Analyst - Paralegal - 2022-1084,"Washington, DC",$55K - $84K (Glassdoor est.),"Overview:
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
In 2017, the Department of Commerce (DOC) was asked to conduct an investigation into the impact on our national security from imports of steel mill products and from imports of wrought and unwrought aluminum. These investigations were carried out under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended. On January 11, 2018, the DOC formally submitted to President Trump the results of the investigation. On March 8, 2018 President Trump announced Presidential Proclamations 9704 and 9705 ordering Section 232 tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum. The Secretary of Commerce has the authority to grant exclusions from the duties, “if the steel or aluminum articles are determined not to be in a sufficient and reasonable available amount or of a satisfactory quality or based upon specific national security considerations.” Individuals or organizations using steel articles in business activities or supplying steel to users in the U.S. may submit exclusion requests with respect to the Proclamation. In addition, any individual or organization in the U.S. can file objections to exclusions. The DOC’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has the lead on national security analysis. The Enforcement and Compliance (E&C) unit of the DOC’s International Trade Administration is responsible for providing technical analyses for product exclusions related to the proceedings and submitting a recommendation to BIS on whether the technical merits of the request and objections warrant approving or denying the exclusion request. Currently, E&C does not have sufficient staff resources with the expertise required to evaluate the exclusion requests and objections to requests. Information on the exclusion procedures can be found here: https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/232-steel
