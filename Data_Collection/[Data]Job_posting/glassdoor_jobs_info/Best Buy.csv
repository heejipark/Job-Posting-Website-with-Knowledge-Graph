Job summary
At Amazon Web Services (AWS), we provide world-class, flexible, scalable, and secure cloud services to the world’s fastest growing startups, the largest enterprises, and leading government agencies. We do this by building, maintaining, and securing one of the largest, most complex infrastructures in the world. Within AWS, the Infrastructure Security – Threat, Vulnerability, and Operations (InfraSec-TVO) organization is comprised of multiple teams responsible for threat and vulnerability management, software security, and security operations across the global AWS infrastructure.

The AWS InfraSec-TVM team is looking for a Security Engineer with deep expertise in threat intelligence and vulnerability management to join us in building and maturing the Infrastructure Security Threat and Vulnerability Management program. In this role, you will be responsible for leading the identification, assessment, and remediation of threats and vulnerabilities across millions of infrastructure assets. You will leverage relationships with device owners, infrastructure engineers, and leaders throughout AWS to prioritize risk assessments and the implementation of mitigating and compensating controls. Finally, you will work with other InfraSec-TVM security engineers and software developers on improving processes and tooling for not only threat and vulnerability management, but also security information and event management (SIEM), detection engineering, incident response, and application security.

AWS leads and innovates. We don’t just buy off-the-shelf software or follow others. We research and pursue the best approach for the business, whether that’s building new solutions or leveraging existing ones. AWS, and Infrastructure Security in particular, operate at massive scale and as a result, demand the highest standards, passion, and discipline for information security and software engineering. A high level of ownership and accountability is a must for this role.

Preferred locations for this role are Minneapolis, Minnesota or Seattle, Washington, however remote candidates will also be considered.

Amazon is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace. Amazon is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, protected veteran status, disability, age, or other legally protected status.
