Who is Mastercard?
Mastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry. Our mission is to connect and power an inclusive, digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere by making transactions safe, simple, smart, and accessible. Using secure data and networks, partnerships and passion, our innovations and solutions help individuals, financial institutions, governments, and businesses realize their greatest potential.
Our decency quotient, or DQ, drives our culture and everything we do inside and outside of our company. With connections across more than 210 countries and territories, we are building an inclusive and sustainable world that unlocks priceless possibilities for all.
Overview
Digital First solutions enable our partners to provide entirely digital payment experiences for consumers, with a physical card option. By combining Mastercard products and services with qualified third-party partners, we support each step of the digital consumer journey all the way from acquisition and card usage to management, and engagement.

Payments are on the precipice of industry-wide change driven by consumer demands for immediacy and convenience, and digital first experiences are leading the way. 56% of consumers believe receiving and using digital cards instead of physical cards is a behavior that’s here to stay, and the pandemic has reinforced the need to meet consumers wherever they are. Mastercard’s Digital First Card Program, launched in 2019, continues to gain momentum as consumers seek out digitally-native, secure payments solutions.
Role
“Scaling Digital First Solutions” is a key strategic priority for Mastercard. By leveraging key partners across priority markets and customer segments, we can simplify implementation and drive scale more quickly. The Partnership Administrator role plays an important part in ensuring our partners are well informed, tracking to their KPIs and have the appropriate materials for sales and education.

Responsibilities include the creation and management of a partnership dashboard, the management of the global partnership pipeline (partner interactions, data gathering, data analysis etc.), working closely with Regional product teams and cross functional teams to ensure alignment on initiatives, supporting the commercialization of a number of new strategic partnerships (creating partner/Mastercard sales materials, creation and execution of a set of regional go-to-market plans) and engaging in competitive and partner capability research.

In addition, to help educate issuers globally on Digital First and our Digital First partners, create materials and organize educational webinars focused on partner digital first capabilities and a digital first partnerships product knowledge series.
All About You
You will have relevant experience in the payment industry, product management and/or product development, with experience in the consumer and digital payments space. You have a strong interest in digital payment solutions and initiatives and may have had recent involvement. You will have strong interpersonal and collaborative skills to develop relationships and partnerships with a broad range of individuals across the organization and externally.
