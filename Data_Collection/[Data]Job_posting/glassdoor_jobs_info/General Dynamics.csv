Job Description:
Leidos has a career opportunity for a talented Training Developer in support of the Army’s Synthetic Training Environment (STE). Leidos is seeking a mid-level Training Developer to support the creation, validation, delivery and training of a complex distributed simulation-based training system. The position will require a fair amount of independence and will interact on a daily basis with a broad range of other technical skills to complete the tasks needed. An outgoing personality that seeks to find the necessary data and transform it into innovate video and online training solutions is required. This position will have primary responsibility for an assigned range of documents and training outcomes which will be merged into a larger training and support package to be delivered to the customer. Position requires maturity and the ability to operate in a fluid environment where the candidate will need to take initiative to define the correct answers and initiate contact to resolve uncertainties. This will be a collaborative position in an Agile team-based program.

A successful candidate will be primarily involved with the development of new content, and the merging together of inputs from multiple source to create a single integrated set of documentation and training materials. Scope of specific responsibilities may include supporting the development of technical manuals. An understanding of AI driven training architecture may be useful. Implementation of a modern simulation driven training system will be directly supported by the integration and consolidation of materials from multiple sources into a single coherent training capability. Candidate may have the opportunity to conduct training in conjunction with the materials being developed but a self-contain (instructorless) training solution is the ultimate goal.

A successful candidate will demonstrate a good aptitude for problem solving, be organized and able to communicate at a high level. Knowledge of fundamental constructs such as learning theory/instructional development is considered essential at the start. Ability to translate technical jargon into more easily understandable prose is essential. Ability to understand and communicate with technical staff is considered a standard part of the position.

The successful candidate will have the following responsibilities:
