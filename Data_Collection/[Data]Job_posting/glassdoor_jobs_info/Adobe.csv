The Opportunity
Frame.io, an Adobe Company, is changing the future of how videos are made by helping over 1 million creative professionals seamlessly collaborate from all over the world.
Engineers at Frame.io are creative, technical people making beautiful and powerful tools to enable other creative, technical people to do their best work—Frame.io is the thread that runs through the entire video post-production process. The product and engineering team at Frame.io bases our process on five principles:

We always come back to the problem to solve.

We explore solutions at the right level of detail.

We give full responsibility to designers and engineers during their phases of a project.

We ship often to ensure we deliver value to customers often.
We are looking for a senior back-end engineer who can turn ideas into beautifully written code that other people—or you, six months into the future—will find easy to comprehend and modify. You will:

Model a rich and expansive domain. You’ll design and implement data models for every facet of the post-production domain, as well as powerful systems to keep the Frame.io application efficient and stable.

Contribute to a mature (but not too crufty!) Elixir application. Frame.io is home to one of the largest Elixir applications in the world, and senior engineers here have the opportunity to design highly concurrent, fault-tolerant systems.

Own the implementation of great features. You’ll work directly with designers, client engineers and product owners to bring new features to life. You’ll provide guidance and input into the process of building and deploying their vision, as well as writing the code that makes it real.

Guide and mentor your fellow engineers. You’ll be an authority on best practices for the engineering team, as well as an important leader for other engineers in the organization - back-end and otherwise.
Our team is highly productive and committed to mutual support, collaboration and knowledge-sharing. We are dedicated to a work environment where we can all grow and learn, and combine this commitment with a dedication to quality engineering and sound, informed technical decisions. We understand that the best code is the code that moves our business forward, and we make every decision about the back-end in the context of the product that everybody at Frame.io is building together. What you'll Do

Write solid and scalable code.

Doing regular code reviews.

Building new features and services in Elixir.

Providing technical leadership to junior engineers. What you need to succeed

Extensive, solid experience in designing and developing multiple large-scale Web application back-ends.

Experience in Elixir or a comparable functional programming language.

Experience in MySQL or PostgreSQL outside of an ORM, including the ability to design SQL queries for performance and efficiency.

Familiarity with common API and services design best practices.

Deep experience in overall system design and implementation—how they scale, how they should fit together, and how they’re likely to break.

Experience migrating legacy components with little to no downtime.

Ability to analyze and solve difficult problems across the back-end.

Does this sound like you?
We're looking for the ultimate technical program leader.

Regularly summarize and communicate progress to executives.
What you'll get
You'll report to a manager who is invested in you as a person and who loves to mentor. We want you to grow and thrive. After a year people should be asking for you by name!

At Adobe people actually take vacation. We have two shutdowns every year – no overflowing inbox upon your return. Adobe also provides a paid sabbatical every 5 years.
What you need to succeed

Past experience in technical roles or a computer science related education is required.
Extraordinary follow through – things do not fall through the cracks.
Your emails are seen as models of clarity. Keeping your inbox in order is a given.
