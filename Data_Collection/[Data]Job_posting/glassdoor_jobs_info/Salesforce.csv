When a user tries a new system, they expect it to be intuitive and run smoothly. Functionality, reliability, and user experience are key to successful information systems–and that means rigorous testing. That’s why we need you, an aspiring quality assurance specialist who’s eager to help thoroughly test software and ensure that our team releases the best system possible.
As a Salesforce quality assurance specialist, you’ll work with analysts, testers, developers, and engineers on a team that evaluates developed systems to support the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). You’ll help develop and implement a test plan based on requirements, functional specifications, and design specifications. Using requirements analysis and software quality assurance, you’ll generate problem resolutions and track quality assurance standards to see how the system performs, then document the results and communicate system flaws to the development team so they can start improving the tool. You’ll build your experience in various types of testing, including manual, performance, accessibility, usability, user acceptance testing, and testing process improvement. This is an opportunity to broaden your skills in documenting and solving system deficiencies as well as leading and mentoring others and estimating testing efforts.
