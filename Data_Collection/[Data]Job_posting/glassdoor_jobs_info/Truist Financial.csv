This role is a Product Manager who balances business, technology and design priorities to deliver brand-defining product and service experiences. The Product Manager will work with the Product Owner to convert the vision into a level of detail that the Product Owner and Agile delivery team can then prioritize as epics and features.

The Product Manager has business goals and is responsible for developing and maintaining a strategic delivery roadmap that supports those business goals. This position must be able to work at the strategic level (generating innovative ideas for growth) and at the tactical level (analyzing data, solving problems, and working with delivery teams for development). This position will help monitor and drive the business on all aspects of demand, customer experience, and conversion. NOTE: In some Agile teams, there may be Product Owners/Managers from both the Business and the Tech side. In that case, the role will remain the same and there is joint accountability for the Agile team’s results. In rare instances, where the business cannot provide a resource, a Tech resource could step in to fulfill the responsibilities.

The ideal candidate will have strong experience working in technologies relevant to the area in which they are assigned, in addition to using a Scaled Agile development framework. This person should be able to move fluidly between business stakeholders and technology teams to prioritize the highest value items for delivery.
