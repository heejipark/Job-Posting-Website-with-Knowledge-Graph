What's the Role?
Within the FinTech space, our Blazewater Algorithm team works at the intersection of technology and financial modeling. In 2018, our small team of capable engineers sought to re-architect our core financial-planning algorithm from the ground up, utilizing functional programming in Scala to radically rethink how heuristics-based financial modeling can be implemented at scale. In 2020, we turned our attention to stochastic modeling of portfolio risk in a concurrent, highly-distributed cloud environment. In 2021, we expanded our vision to encompass increasingly sophisticated financial instruments, with a focus on precision, accuracy, and deep levels of plan customization and mathematical optimization. Currently, we are working to take that vision of developing the next generation of financial planning applications forward, along with an increased focus on making our current suite of applications more performant and feature rich. We are looking for driven, financially-minded backend engineers with a passion for building a new class of planning software.
