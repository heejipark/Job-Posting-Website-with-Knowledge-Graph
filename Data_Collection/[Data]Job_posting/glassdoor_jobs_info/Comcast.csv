The dx Team is building the core components needed to drive the next generation of data platforms and data processing capability at Comcast. Building data products, identifying trouble spots, and optimizing the overall user experience is a challenge that can only be met with a robust architecture capable of providing insights that would otherwise be drowned in an ocean of data.

This Platform Engineering role will include a mixture of DevOps responsibilities, chipping in to the software development of the Query Fabric Platform, new software features and defect resolution, day-to-day platform operations and support, and other platforms/technologies (e.g. caching and web services) as needed. You will have the opportunity to make contributions to the Presto codebase as well as other open source projects, and you will be expected to support hundreds (and eventually thousands) of internal customers in their use of this platform.
