As a Hardware Developer at IBM, you’ll get to work on the systems that are driving the quantum revolution and the AI era. Join an elite team of engineering professionals who enable IBM customers to make better decisions quicker on the most trusted hardware platform in today’s market.

Your Role and Responsibilities
At IBM Research, we invent things that matter to the world. Today, we are pioneering the most promising and disruptive technologies that will transform industries and society, including the future of AI, Blockchain and Quantum Computing. We are driven to discover. With more than 3,000 researchers in 12 labs located across six continents, IBM Research is one of the world’s largest and most influential corporate research labs.

IBM’s Strategic Research groups at Albany Nanotech are currently seeking an engineer in the area of test structure design enablement for the world's most advanced semiconductor technologies. We are seeking qualified and motivated candidates for a position as a design layout engineer, including automated layouts and automated design rule checking.

The hired candidate will have experience with electrical engineering, computer engineering, and/or semiconductor characterization. The candidate must understand the fundamental principles of semiconductor processing, electrical testing of semiconductor devices, and/or semiconductor layout design. The candidate will work closely with process development engineers, test structure designers, and layout technicians to create layout automation that meets the intent of the test structure designers. The hired candidate must also possess strong analytical and design-of-experiment knowledge, excellent written and verbal communication skills, and the ability to articulate difficult concepts to an audience with diverse technical backgrounds.

The job responsibilities include developing test structure layouts using both design automation and manual layout per specified requirements, using industry standard (EDA) tools including the Cadence Virtuoso Design Environment and SKILL code. The position involves developing parametrized cells (p-cells) for use in design automation. Engineers in this position interpret design rules and macro specifications, collaborating with engineers from other functional areas to achieve the desired structure while ensuring that designed layouts pass Design Rule Checks (DRC). Specified layouts will be primarily test structures rather than working circuitry. Close and frequent cooperation with development engineers from interdisciplinary teams will be required for this dynamic team environment.",3d,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=108&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=000001846a47a565a7cf432f2a8bc88b&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_53315c14&cb=1668230439877&jobListingId=1008265643855&jrtk=3-0-1ghl4f9crkcmf801-1ghl4f9dvj45o800-0d1dfedde5f2097f-
