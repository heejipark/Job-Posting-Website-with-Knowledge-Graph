We believe there's a $100M+ opportunity in having Dropbox services resold, bundled, and/or otherwise distributed via telcos.
We want you to develop the strategy, pitch it to leading telcos, stand the initial partnerships up, and prove out this hypothesis, so we can make the appropriate investments to grow it to become the nine-figure opportunity it deserves to be.
You should know the space really well, have a rolodex of contacts you can call on, and most importantly, have the 0-to-1 mentality and drive to make something happen where it didn't already exist.
You've got to have strategic vision and then the gusto, salesperson-ship, persistence, and grit to make it a reality.
We're looking for someone who knows how to make magic happen.
We already have most of the distribution APIs you'd need to do this.
You'll also already have a senior-level operations manager to help you stand the initial partnerships up, and we've got a product suite that should be very attractive to telcos.
Specifically, while you likely only think of Dropbox as File, Sync, and Share (FSS), we have expanded into a robust suite of tools that are extremely attractive to our large consumer, prosumer, and SMB customer base, including: e-Signature, Backup and Restore, Password Management, Screen Recording, Large File Delivery, Universal Search, and so much more!
We provide a very competitive comp and benefits package and are a virtual-first company, meaning you get to work from anywhere.
If you can deliver on the above objectives, we can compensate you well and provide an excellent lifestyle.
Responsibilities Develop an overall guiding strategy for this channel Identify high-impact, seven-figure+ revenue-driving partnerships with global Telco companies.

As a Designer, you will work with a technical pre-sales agile team to co-develop innovative business solutions with our clients. You will be directly impacting the world’s most influential enterprises and brands on the adoption of next-generation platforms.

IBM’s comprehensive onboarding program and industry-leading learning culture will prepare you with a strong foundation for client success. Our sales environment is collaborative and experiential. You'll be surrounded by bright minds and keen co-creators ready to assist as you apply practices that will compel our clients to invest in IBM's products and services.


In this role, your primary focus will be facilitating interactive workshops with clients. We have a set of standard approaches, but every engagement is customized. When your Client Engineering team is asked to work on a client project, you will participate in determining the right fit between the client, IBM and best approach for workshop.

A Designer in this position incorporates three roles: Facilitator, Consultant, and Designer:
Following a workshop, you may create designs for a Proof of Concept, a demo, or a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). You may also be engaged in information architecture, research, and/or evaluation.

For this position, the design work is concepts and processes – uncovering business value, defining a problem, shaping solutions, and proving them out. What you’re creating will look less like a visual designer’s portfolio and more like a user researcher’s portfolio.

Opportunities are available in: Atlanta GA, Boston MA, Chicago IL, Dallas TX, New York NY, San Francisco CA, and Washington DC – to name a few.

Initially, there s a lot of foundational work to be done.
Over time, we expect that the problem sets will become less foundational and more advanced requiring more detailed data-driven analysis and review to inform decision-making.

An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI-ers keenly understand how to adjust their support and problem solving based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, SEI-ers possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.
As super-connectors, they connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI-ers frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI-ers are ethical and trustworthy individuals who consistently and repeatedly follow through, and hold true to their values in difficult situations. SEI-ers have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others. As every project is different, an SEI-er must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. SEI-ers define ambition differently. They are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who truly enjoy one another- they like to hang out with colleagues outside of work, collaborate and hold one another accountable.

Initially, there s a lot of foundational work to be done.
Over time, we expect that the problem sets will become less foundational and more advanced requiring more detailed data-driven analysis and review to inform decision-making.
We can t promise that it ll be easy, but we can promise that it ll be a lot of fun and you ll both learn a lot and teach us a lot along the way, too.

For example, Python, Ruby, or Swift Five years experience using source control, such as git, with CI/CD integrations for systems management applications One to three years experience writing and/or designing systems written in Swift, Objective-C, or another combination of languages Excellent presentation and writing skills to both technical and non-technical audiences in a remote environment A bachelor's degree in any field of study or equivalent post-secondary experience providing a depth and breadth of reading, writing, and problem solving experience.
