About Store N o 8

We are the incubation arm of Walmart. Store N o 8 was formed in 2017 as part of Walmart's larger innovation mission to shape the future of commerce. We pursue big ideas and take risks by stepping outside of Walmart's core business to focus on leapfrog capabilities across conversational commerce, mixed reality, in-store digitization, and more. Our ultimate goal: fuel Walmart's core business, create new operational efficiencies, and unlock amazing experiences for our customers in the long-term.

About the Role

Our ultimate goal: fuel Walmart's core business, create new operational efficiencies, and unlock amazing experiences for our customers in the long-term.

This team within Store N°8 is working on healthcare innovations because Walmart's promise is to help its customers save money and live better . This includes building products that enhance both their physical and emotional wellbeing.

Being human-led is our true disruption.



Working virtually this year has helped us make quicker decisions, remove location barriers across our global team, be more flexible in our personal lives and spend less time commuting.
