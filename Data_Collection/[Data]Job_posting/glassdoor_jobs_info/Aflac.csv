CLASSIFICATION DEFINITION
The Eligibility Specialist classifications determine the eligibility of applicants and recipients for public assistance programs through interactive interviewing and fact gathering; maintain current knowledge of program regulations and procedures necessary for multi-program caseload administration; initiate and process casework through automated systems; identify needs and make appropriate referrals for health, social, and/or employment services; and perform related work as required.

Eligibility Specialist I
The Eligibility Specialist I is the entry-level classification in the Eligibility Specialist series. Incumbents may have prior experience determining eligibility for loans, financial assistance, unemployment or veterans benefits, or publicly or privately funded health, counseling or social services programs; have completed initial classroom training provided as part of the Eligibility Specialist Trainee training program; or may have the required level of education. Incumbents will be placed in a work team and initially may receive classroom instruction prior to being assigned casework and/or tasks. Incumbents will work under close supervision while learning to independently determine public assistance eligibility, and apply knowledge and skills learned from their training in completing eligibility tasks and applying complex regulations. As incumbents gain experience and work toward the journey level in the series, they are expected to work with more independence and have the ability to complete more complex tasks and/or handle larger client caseloads. Incumbents are expected to progress to the journey-level Eligibility Specialist II upon completion of one year of satisfactory performance in the entry-level Eligibility Specialist I classification.


The Eligibility Specialist II is the journey-level classification in the Eligibility Specialist series. Incumbents demonstrate working knowledge of eligibility regulations, procedures and eligibility software systems. Eligibility Specialist II incumbents handle more complex tasks and/or caseloads independently with consultation as needed by Eligibility Specialist IIIs or Eligibility Supervisors. Positions in this class are flexibly staffed and are normally filled by advancement from the lower level or if filled from the outside, require prior experience as an Eligibility Specialist, Eligibility Worker or comparable position.
The class of Eligibility Specialist II is distinguished from the Eligibility Specialist I as the latter requires a higher level of consultation and supervision and is working toward achieving a working knowledge of program rules and regulations. The Eligibility Specialist II class is distinguished from the Eligibility Specialist III in that the latter class is assigned lead specialist duties or special assignments with a greater degree of independent judgment.


The Eligibility Specialist III is the advanced journey/lead-level classification and subject matter expert in the Eligibility Specialist series. Incumbents perform the most complex work and specialized assignments requiring an advanced level of technical knowledge in public assistance programs, departmental processes and caseload/workload administration. Incumbents are expected to independently perform specialized and/or complex duties beyond the journey-level classification of the series. In addition, incumbents may perform help desk functions, provide training to a unit of workers determining eligibility for public assistance and/or serve as a lead worker for less experienced employees. Incumbents demonstrate advanced knowledge of eligibility regulations, procedures and eligibility software systems. Other assignments may include performing quality control and/or quality assurance reviews, participating in early fraud prevention programs, representing the County in administrative appeals and fair hearings and/or performing other specialized assignments and related work as required.
The Eligibility Specialist III differs from the Eligibility Supervisor in that the latter directly supervises a unit of Eligibility Specialists. The class of Eligibility Specialist III is distinguished from the Eligibility Specialist II as the latter requires a higher level of supervision and the Eligibility Specialist III is assigned lead specialist duties or special assignments with a greater degree of independent judgment.


Incumbents in the Eligibility Specialist I and II classifications typically receive supervision from an Eligibility Supervisor and may receive lead direction from an Eligibility Specialist III.

Incumbents in the Eligibility Specialist III classification receive supervision from an Eligibility Supervisor or other manager. An Eligibility Specialist III has no responsibility for direct supervision of others, but may provide lead direction to other Eligibility Specialists.",30d+,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=117&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=000001846b466f739cf8358216440b07&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_ef3ab4a9&cb=1668247145478&jobListingId=1008159277522&jrtk=3-0-1ghlkcrtcma7t801-1ghlkcru1h4f9800-9825b792da3b022d-
