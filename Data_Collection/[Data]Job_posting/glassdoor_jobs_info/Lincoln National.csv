For the last thirty years, high-throughput technologies have enabled the generation, analysis, and characterization of billions of health data. Much of this data represents discrete snapshots of biological processes rather than whole systems. As a result, life sciences is ripe for piecing data together in the form of digital twins. In 2003, Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group (IMAG) was formed to prioritize this vision. IMAG is represented by all U.S. federal agencies (NSF, FDA, NIH, USDA, DoD, etc.) – significant sources of federal funds for the University of Nebraska - Lincoln (UNL) investigators. In 2022, the FDA announced its intention to supplement or replace human clinical trials with models simulated on virtual patients – i.e., digital twins. Currently, no large-scale digital twin of any human system exists. Digital Twin Innovation Hub is developing the first Digital Twin of the Human Immune System. Digital Twin Innovation Hub is also developing infrastructure that can represent molecular, cellular, tissular, and organismal systems functioning as any single system to investigate behaviors that cannot be simulated apart from the complete system.",30d+,

For the last thirty years, high-throughput technologies have enabled the generation, analysis, and characterization of billions of health data. Much of this data represents discrete snapshots of biological processes rather than whole systems. As a result, life sciences is ripe for piecing data together in the form of digital twins. In 2003, Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group (IMAG) was formed to prioritize this vision. IMAG is represented by all U.S. federal agencies (NSF, FDA, NIH, USDA, DoD, etc.) – significant sources of federal funds for the University of Nebraska - Lincoln (UNL) investigators. In 2022, the FDA announced its intention to supplement or replace human clinical trials with models simulated on virtual patients – i.e., digital twins. Currently, no large-scale digital twin of any human system exists. Digital Twin Innovation Hub is developing the first Digital Twin of the Human Immune System.

This includes security for critical infrastructure, land and maritime borders, transportation systems, and soft targets / crowded places. It also includes support for law enforcement, special operations, and intelligence analysts who track and disrupt transnational criminal and terrorist organizations. To do this, we work on a combination of novel sensing technologies and data analytics techniques in order to provide better threat awareness to decision makers. We design systems that collect and process a wide range of data types — including radar, visible imagery and video, non-visible imagery, text, time-series data, and 3D point clouds — often applying advanced machine learning methods to convert raw data into actionable insights. We place an emphasis on taking technology from the concept phase through deployment and transition in order to achieve operational impact.",8d,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=127&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=000001846c0ef9b0bc0143be79e1844c&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_2c2cb3e4&cb=1668260321076&jobListingId=1008255329300&jrtk=3-0-1ghm0tuf1ma6j801-1ghm0tufkirl2800-c7dad3238b965ea1-
