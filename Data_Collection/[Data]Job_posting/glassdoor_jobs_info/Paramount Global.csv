Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.
Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.",24h,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=128&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=0000018469fd2217bc76fbf1ad8876ed&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_1bc5445c&cb=1668225591840&jobListingId=1008273282457&jrtk=3-0-1ghkvq8hti7lj801-1ghkvq8inii3h800-35a560a4cc2a569f-

And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.
