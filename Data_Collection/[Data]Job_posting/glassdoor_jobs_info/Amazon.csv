Job summary
Are you ready to drive the next generation of shopping innovations at Amazon? When words just aren’t enough to describe what customers are looking for, they often turn to other methods such as camera-based search, or using the picture of a celebrity to find inspiration for their fashion purchases. When images aren’t enough to convince customers that a piece of furniture will look good, they want to turn to Augmented Reality to envision how that furniture item would match their living room décor.

Starting in 2009, the Visual Search team has thus far launched many visual search solutions on the Amazon App that use computer vision and machine learning/deep learning to help customers complete their shopping missions more easily; multiple internal teams at Amazon (devices, Kindle, Seller services, etc.) also use our libraries and APIs to deliver solutions to their own customers.

The Visual Search & Augmented Reality team is looking for a talented, creative, and customer-obsessed Senior Product Designer to join the team in our downtown Palo Alto, CA location.

As a Senior Product Designer, you will be involved in every aspect of the product development process, from conceptualizing the next generation of visual shopping applications to designing incremental features.

You are strategic and highly collaborative and will work closely with a team of passionate designers, product managers, and software developers to create the conceptual and interaction flows and prototypes for new and existing applications and experiences. You will be a leading voice for customers, diving deep on their needs and aspirations to help them realize their goals. Along the way, you will be expected to use your full range of interaction design, prototyping and production skills. You will also mentor and coach junior designers.

Our team, AWS Systems Manager, is looking for a Senior SDE to build highly distributed systems aimed at providing safe operating capabilities for our customers. You should be passionate about being part of a world-class team that welcomes, celebrates, and leverages a diverse set of backgrounds and skill sets to deliver results. Driving results in a way that builds on our inclusive culture is expected of a Senior SDE and is key to our long term success. AWS Systems Manager is the operations hub for the AWS cloud. Many customers from startups to enterprises are running their entire infrastructure or parts of it in AWS. Operating this infrastructure in the cloud in a reliable way is absolutely important to our customers and we are a core part of that story. Many IT administrators and DevOps engineers rely on Systems Manager to operate their infrastructure safely and securely at scale. Systems Manager provides a unified operational dashboard to view operational data from multiple AWS services, manage large fleet of instances, manage their distributed applications as a single unit and automate their operational tasks/runbooks and define safe operational workflows. More info on Systems Manager can be found here: https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/. About Us Work/Life Balance: Our team values work-life balance. We value different lifestyles that people have – e.g. daycare pickups, helping a partner who works weekends, caring for aging parents, going to the gym once a day - and we want to provide an inclusive environment for everyone. Most days, our entire team is co-located in the Seattle office, but we’re also flexible when people occasionally need to work from home. We generally keep core in-office hours from 10am to 4pm. About half of us come in earlier and the other half of us stay later. We are builder-operators of our services at AWS and have an on-call rotation where you’ll participate once every 5-6 weeks. We work to reduce our on-call load by ensuring that our systems are fault tolerant, and resolve the root cause of an issue so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice. Mentorship and Career Growth: We are focused on the growth and development of every member of the team, and that includes our Senior SDEs. You will have the opportunity to contribute to the culture and direction of the entire Systems Manager organization and deliver initiatives that will improve the life of all of our teams. This is a growth environment - we’re hiring and scaling rapidly to meet the needs of our customers. You’ll have the opportunity to grow your scope of influence naturally as we scale and we will have to hire and develop others along the way. Here at AWS, we embrace our differences.

Job summary Job Summary Search M5 is hiring engineers with solid fundamentals across the AI stack to deliver the next step-change innovation in cloud-scale AI. An ideal candidate should have experience and comfort in working with low to middle layers of the AI stack such as accelerators, ML compilers, and collectives/deep learning libraries. Comprehensive ML modeling experience is not a pre-requisite. However the candidate should have enough understanding of ML algorithms to be able to understand and work backwards from existing models’ scalability limits. As an engineer in M5 you will deal with production-grade, hyper-scale model training and inference on AWS. The cost and time efficiency is paramount in productizing M5 models to delight Amazon customers. You will work across the AI stack from hardware accelerators to ML science to make the training and application of large models both tractable and practical. We would like you to build solutions where the hardware, platform, and software are working in harmony to deliver the best performance-per-dollar. About the Team Our Mission The M5 program builds universal state-of-the-art semantic representations of Amazon-specific entities (ASINs, queries, customers, sellers, shopping sessions, reviews, etc.) and vends them to machine learning systems across Amazon. The representations we build will be multi-entity, multi-modal, multi-lingual, multi-locale, and multi-task (hence M5), and will utilize all available data for each entity, preferably using their combination. Culture and Scope Thanks to our ambitious mission statement, every day is Day 1 with a ton of uncharted territory for you to explore and own. Operating at Amazon-scale we regularly push the scalability limits of all components of the AI stack. Therefore, we collaborate with both internal and external teams to drive roadmaps, features, and fixes. You are encouraged to fix-at-source rather than creating workarounds and upstream your contributions to open source projects (e.g. PyTorch) that we use in M5. Exploration is built into the DNA of the team and we highly value technical fearlessness and bias-for-action. Basic Qualifications * Degree in Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, or related disciplines. * 4+ years of industry experience in building production-grade AI stack; training and/or inference. * Solid understanding of — and experience with — cloud infrastructure (preferably AWS) and high-performance-computing techniques. Preferred Qualifications * Contributed feature(s) to deep learning libraries (e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow), domain libraries (e.g. torchvision), collective libraries (e.g. NCCL, MPI), ML compilers (e.g. XLA, TVM). * Experience in accelerator/compiler-level programming (e.g. CUDA).",30d+,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=129&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=0000018469215bd990ae72d5802a2039&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_a70fb71d&cb=1668211197443&jobListingId=1008156978416&jrtk=3-0-1ghki2n0v2jqc001-1ghki2n1iitnc800-d298eef6bad4acd3-

Job summary
Amazon Business launched in 2015 and reached $1B in its first year, and $15B in 2020. As part this growth, we are starting a new greenfield initiative know as Amazon Catalog. This new initiative will be led by a team of entrepreneurial makers. They will create a seamless experience between B2B buyers and sellers to manage items, prices, and catalogs. As part of Amazon’s efforts to be “Earth’s most customer-centric company” we will enable businesses to configure their Amazon Catalog. This solution will allow businesses to use Amazon as their one stop procurement solution. Amazon Business aspires to be the preferred choice for all types of business (sole proprietors, small businesses, schools, universities, hospitals, government, enterprises (and everything else). The needs of these business customers are different from those of the traditional Amazon customer, so we are reinventing everything from how we offer our selection, pricing, customer experience, and unparalleled customer service. We have the opportunity to disrupt how businesses buy in this modern age.

We are seeking a talented Software Development Manager (SDM) with an entrepreneurial mindset who likes solving high scale problems across a broad domain of distributed services and customer shopping experiences. This SDM will manage a core team of developers who will build out Amazon Business’s “Amazon Catalog” project. The technology stack will include web, mobile, and back-end technologies built upon the one and only, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This SDM will create new products that serve business customers, and be a technical mentor to their team.

As the SDM of this new team you will create and manage a roadmap of features that span the entire Retail Shopping experience of Amazon. You will be part of a new team that owns all aspects of the Amazon Catalog experience; catalog creation, buyer shopping, ordering, and seller configurations. You will design and build solutions that help buyers create custom catalogs of items and prices. You will join on the ground floor of the project, and work with best-in-class product managers to influence how that catalog management solution will be built. You will get to be customer obsessed about both suppliers and the businesses that buy from them. Your solution will span Amazon’s entire technology stack and be deployed worldwide. What you build will be seen by hundreds of thousands of customers.

You will join an organization with strong ownership of what we develop, a passion to provide great customer experiences, and a bold vision to impact customers worldwide. Your team will work tirelessly to help solve critical customer needs, break daily to enjoy the latest Boba Tea available. On Fridays we spend time to bond over board games and celebrate our successes. This team will be located in sunny Austin, Texas; the live music capital of the world.

A day in the life

A typical day will consist of standard team stand-ups and progress checks. You may have one-on-one sessions with your engineers to check in on career development. You will resolve team blockers, and meet with your product/business stakeholders to discuss the strategy and vision of your products. You may also find yourself working to recruit talent, write some SQL queries to investigate anomalies, or participate in a design review on a new technical solution. Your team will likely try and distract you with Nerf darts, or board games at lunch if you happen to be in the office.

About the hiring group

You will report to highly seasoned Amazon leaders, and have access to heavily tenured Senior Software Development engineers within Amazon Business. You will have a highly diverse team with skills ranging from front end software development to data architecture and analytics. The team will be located in Austin, Texas. Teams often hangout daily to play board games during lunch, or take lunch at ""The Domain"" shopping center near the office.

Do you consider yourself one of the premier Network Engineers in the industry today? Would you like the opportunity to become even better and face unparalleled, yet fascinating challenges? The Enterprise Network Engineering team at Amazon is looking for a highly experienced Network Engineer to architect and design for Amazon's internal facilities around the globe. This position will collaborate with a team of like-minded engineers located in different regions around the world to design and shape the future of data networks at Amazon.

Responsibilities Include:

Experience managing large projects to completion is a must, either as project manager or lead. NDEs are expected to self-manage several projects at a time, providing regular status updates and identifying and pushing through obstacles.

As a Network Development Engineer at Amazon, your core job responsibility is to design network topologies, architectures, and services that solve for many requirements. We listen to our customers (both internal and external), but we also listen to our teams. Our Engineers contribute materially to each team’s roadmap, and constantly help us to determine what’s most important. Together, you and your leadership team will decide on the projects that best support your team’s mission. You will have the resources and time necessary to understand, scope, and deliver these solutions. The primary area of responsibility you and your team will have is to design ahead of customer or technology needs, always predicting and solving for problems that have not yet occurred. This takes the form of creating and defending High Level Design (HLD) documents, working with vendors or internal stakeholders to influence technology roadmaps, constructing and testing your solutions, and providing support to the teams that will deploy and operate these designs. Our teams also serve as technical escalation points in support of our very talented operations teams.

Our ideal candidate is highly autonomous, possesses strong written and verbal communication skills, strong project management and time management skills and has a successful track record of designing simple, scalable solutions and troubleshooting complex network problems and delivering innovative solutions.
