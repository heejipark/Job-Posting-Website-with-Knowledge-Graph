The primary responsibility for the Pricing team is to accurately and systematically value each individual car that we buy and sell. Last year, CarMax sold over 1 million vehicles and appraised over 2 million vehicles, and Pricing directed over $20B in spend to purchase inventory.

1) Develop new models and improve our existing models

2) Help CarMax continue to develop its data expertise
