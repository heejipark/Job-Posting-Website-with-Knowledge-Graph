We keep hearing that Identity is the new Perimeter. Functions like Zero-Trust, Privileged Access Management, and Cloud Security rely on Identity. In this case, Identity, and access management, are more than the identity of a user. It is the identity of anything that interacts with information or the technical environment: users, administrators, interfaces, applications, devices, APIs, databases, websites, etc. Managing those takes more than basic knowledge. It takes knowledge and experience about the entire information security ecosystem.

UW Credit Union’s Information Security team is expanding and hiring an Information Security Analyst II! This role will focus and serve as a subject matter expert in Identity.

At UW Credit Union, data security is a top priority. Without it, we wouldn’t have grown to over 300,000 members or become one of Wisconsin’s top financial institutions. In today’s connected world, access to data is essential, so is protecting it. At UW Credit Union, we have an obligation to keep our member’s and employee’s information safe. We need you to help us continue our journey to serve (and protect!) our members.

Job Description:
What You'll Do
Take your career to the next level by joining a Cisco Team that is supporting major business and technology transformations for our Federal Department of Defense (DoD) customers!

This position requires a motivated, experienced Customer Delivery Consulting Engineer to support Network Security in a large strategic enterprise organization, aligned to an aggressive transformational agenda. We are ""Cisco's Face to the Customer,"" working in a fast-paced, high-impact environment as a critical, visible contributor to the Cisco/Client team. A seasoned mix of broad networking knowledge and specific area expertise, as well as excellent communication and consulting skills, has well-positioned this Cisco team as trusted advisors with the Department of Navy. As a Customer Delivery Consulting Engineer who specializes in Cisco Security solutions, you will support the Navy, United States Marine Corps and the Department of Defense through the development of complex designs, implementation support of Cisco leading edge technologies, and delivery of optimization services to one of Cisco's largest customers in the United States.

Who You'll Work With
The Depart of the Navy (DoN) team is comprised of geographically dispersed engineers that design, architect, and support work on critical DoD owned networks with leading edge Cisco solutions. This team is leading the way in providing foundational engineering and operations support to both the Navy and United States Marine Corps customers that expect their networks and data centers to perform at the highest possible levels. We work with our customer in getting their infrastructure ready for future architectures and solutions and assisting them in navigating through proof of concept and introduction of the same. Strong relationship building and interpersonal skills are traits of successful consultants in this organization. We are strongly focused on continuous development and training on new products/technologies that keep us in a leading position as industry network consulting leaders.
As part of this team, you will work directly with our customers and gain hands-on experience and exposure into their networks. You will collaborate on a variety of projects that have a real impact on the lives of Veterans and military service members. We will value your ideas and perspective on how to get things done. You will work on network infrastructures and help to deliver business solutions and technology solutions from data, security, mobility, and cloud.

Who You Are
The candidate has 5+ years of experience as a network engineer supporting Cisco technologies/products in a large-scale enterprise environment, with a deep understanding of data networks and solid foundation in Security technologies. Large scale enterprise design and deployment experience is desired, as is a CCIE. The candidate must be willing to travel up to 25% of the time to Cisco and/or Customer locations across and outside CONUS. Military Veterans who meet these requirements are encouraged to apply.


Extensive experience with security technologies including solution design, deployment, and troubleshooting.
Ability to lead, articulate a vision, influence, and guide teams in dynamic strategic environments through design, deployment, analysis, and troubleshooting of complex networks.
Capability to evaluate risks, anticipate issues and proactively collaborate and lead resolution
Significant experience with end-to-end architecture/design work as well as strong analytical and problem-solving skills and ability to troubleshoot complex technical problems
Strong communication, consulting, and customer relationship building skills with ability to work autonomously and thrive in a transformational environment
Ability to travel to customer sites outside the Continental United States up to 25%

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
