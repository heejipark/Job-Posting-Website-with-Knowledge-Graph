COMPANY PROFILE
Rhythm AI is a young and innovative Medical Software company. We are developing a new way of locating the areas within the heart responsible for the most common heart rhythm disorder: atrial fibrillation (AF). Its proprietary STAR Mapping™ software helps guide doctors during ablation procedures and will enable them to make sense of the vast quantities of data gathered.
STAR Mapping is a new, AI driven mapping system developed using novel computer algorithms to identify the sources or drivers of AF from data acquired from the 3D Mapping equipment.
Outcomes in a single center study published in May 2019 demonstrated that 80% of patients treated in a single procedure using STAR Mapping were free of AF without the use of anti-arrhythmia drugs at an average of 18.5 months follow-up. This compares very favorably to a study published in 2015, which demonstrated 48% of patients free form AF at 18 months follow-up using the standard mapping treatment.",30d+,

Its proprietary STAR Mapping™ software helps guide doctors during ablation procedures and will enable them to make sense of the vast quantities of data gathered.
STAR Mapping is a new, AI driven mapping system developed using novel computer algorithms to identify the sources or drivers of AF from data acquired from the 3D Mapping equipment.
Outcomes in a single center study published in May 2019 demonstrated that 80% of patients treated in a single procedure using STAR Mapping were free of AF without the use of anti-arrhythmia drugs at an average of 18.5 months follow-up. This compares very favorably to a study published in 2015, which demonstrated 48% of patients free form AF at 18 months follow-up using the standard mapping treatment.",30d+,

COMPANY OVERVIEW
We're Kolena, an early stage startup focused on building an ML testing platform for teams to ship their ML products with confidence.
One of the hardest problems that ML teams face is the lack of ability to identify (and track) the success and failure modes of their models. Data scientists currently rely on statistical metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, etc. to understand areas of strengths and weaknesses. However, these techniques leave huge blind spots that fail to capture the full behavior of the model. Metrics reported in terms of these aggregated statistics don’t provide information on failures across various types of cases, attributes, and scenarios. Even when a model is improved to report a higher overall accuracy, surprising shifts can occur in the distribution of errors — including new ones.

COMPANY PROFILE
Rhythm AI is a young and innovative Medical Software company. We are developing a new way of locating the areas within the heart responsible for the most common heart rhythm disorder: atrial fibrillation (AF). Its proprietary STAR Mapping™ software helps guide doctors during ablation procedures and will enable them to make sense of the vast quantities of data gathered.
STAR Mapping is a new, AI driven mapping system developed using novel computer algorithms to identify the sources or drivers of AF from data acquired from the 3D Mapping equipment.
Outcomes in a single center study published in May 2019 demonstrated that 80% of patients treated in a single procedure using STAR Mapping were free of AF without the use of anti-arrhythmia drugs at an average of 18.5 months follow-up. This compares very favorably to a study published in 2015, which demonstrated 48% of patients free form AF at 18 months follow-up using the standard mapping treatment.",30d+,
