Lam is developing a new dry resist technology that will help extend the resolution, productivity, and yield of EUV lithography. Lam’s dry resist solutions offer significant EUV sensitivity and resolution advantages, which in turn contributes to more economic costs for each EUV wafer pass.
Dry photoresist is a revolutionary technique using dry technologies instead of the existing wet spin coating and development. The key advantages are stability, photosensitivity, environmental footprint, and cost. This evolving technology has demonstrated best-in-class resist performance at leading edge design rules and opens the door to a new world of innovations in EUV lithography patterning.
This significant opportunity for Lam means that we need to hire the best and the brightest talent to take this innovation to the next level.
