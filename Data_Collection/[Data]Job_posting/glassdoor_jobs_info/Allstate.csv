Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

Effectively influences business partner adoption of insights and solutions; demonstrates knowledge of business problems, requirements and context
Develops and delivers communications for complex technical projects to non-technical audiences (appropriate audience, vehicle, level of detail, urgency)
Balance the need for analytic models to be delivered in 2022 while also investing in a pipeline of research for future analytic opportunities.
