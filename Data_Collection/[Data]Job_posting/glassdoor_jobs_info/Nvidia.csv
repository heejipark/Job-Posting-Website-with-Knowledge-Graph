With critical thinking and flexibility, you quickly seek out the accurate data sources, sift through the raw data and turn it into valuable intelligence. If you have strong analytical skills and a problem-solving mindset, we have an opportunity to use those skills to protect our national security.
As an Intelligence analyst on our team, you’ll explore new data sources, create effective narratives, and combine information from disparate sources to help your client understand their mission environment. You’ll learn how to validate the information and apply client tradecraft as you help build assessments for senior policymakers. This is a chance to grow your expertise in researching, drafting, and publishing time-sensitive assessments. You’ll develop new skills in evaluating entities suspected of targeting US interests and proprietary technology and evaluate foreign threats. We focus on growing as a team to deliver the best support to our customers, so you’ll have resources for mentoring and learning new skills and tools. Join us as we provide the right information at the right time to support the critical needs of our policymakers. This position will require local travel to accommodate client needs, when necessary, and is located in McLean, VA.
