Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

To solve this problem, we expanded into software and built integrated solutions to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.
Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time.

CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product.

The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, correlates malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments.

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

To solve this problem, we expanded into software and built integrated solutions to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place.

About the Role:
This role is for a Linux Developer in the engineering team that makes filesystem interactions and metadata visible to detections logic. We work both in the kernel and in user-space, primarily in C++. Since we’re working with the filesystem; performance and stability are crucial, as is understanding when we need to pay attention and when we can get out of the way. The team is cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS), and collaborates closely to produce cross-platform designs and code where possible. Many features are built in a way that they leverage shared components across Windows and Mac, and we want to enable that commonality. Although we focus on filesystem work, we have wide latitude to work on things that need attention or present opportunities, so we’re not limited to the filesystem.

And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Job Description
As a technology centric and end to end customer experience driven company, Comcast has embarked on a bold journey to embrace cloud computing and cloud-based technologies across its entire business.
With this goal in mind, over the last several years, many Engineering organizations across Comcast have begun to leverage cloud solutions and services to modernize their infrastructures and establish their future platforms for innovation.

The Cloud Kubernetes Engineering team is currently responsible for the largest federated deployment of Kubernetes within Comcast today. Our platform supports high-performance video application delivery to data centers all over the country, multiple partner datacenters and is expanding overseas.
In parallel, this team is developing a next-generation Container platform that will enable the rapid delivery of all Containerized applications across Comcast, in a hybrid cloud model. Our success is measured by the stability and scalability of our platform as more products and applications are migrated to containerized architectures.
Everything our team writes is coordinated into a CI/CD pipeline that tests our code, builds containers, and deploys working systems into lab and staging environments. We work closely with a team of infrastructure and network engineers.


We are seeking a Principal Engineer who will play a leading role in designing, deploying, and operating our next generation private cloud environments. This engineer will provide technical leadership across multiple product teams including software development, compute, storage and networking. You will need to have the technical depth to engage with the engineers building and operating our products, and the communications skills to work with executives as we design our long term platform strategy.
We are very interested in attracting a diverse range of candidates from different backgrounds. If you aren’t sure if you qualify, please err on the side of applying. What you can expect:
This role will be responsible for leading a technical team that supports the engineering and integration efforts of existing Cloud platforms (on prem and public cloud) as well as future, next-generation container technology and solutions. This person will lead a team of more junior engineers, fulfilling the role of a mentor in all aspects of the technical stack, including infrastructure, network, storage, and containers, specifically Kubernetes. This person will track their team’s work and give regular status updates to leadership. This person will be responsible for communicating in both user documentation and technical presentations.

What you need to succeed (these should be our role minimum requirements)

10 years of experience in the technology industry

5+ years of experience with software development

Experience working on projects relating to large-scale, highly available customer-facing products and services.

source control (Git/Hg/Subversion); continuous integration; automated testing; automated deployments and deployment pipelines

Familiarity with microservices and cloud native architectures and an understanding of design principles for scalability, performance, and reliability

Familiarity with distributed systems, asynchronous messaging, and networking protocols

Experience with several open source applications, frameworks, and libraries

Golang, Python

Kubernetes

Distributed systems architecture (Databases, caches, etc)

CI/CD - Concourse, Spinnaker, ArgoCD (or similar)

Containerization (Docker, rkt, container, crio, etc)

Network - IPVS load balancing, BGP, general OSI network

Public cloud experience (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc)

Storage (Block/Object/File)

Regular and consistent attendance.

Other duties and responsibilities as assigned. Our Team

We have a bias for action and outcomes

We are agile and seek continuous improvement

We take our work seriously, but don't take ourselves too seriously

We are passionate about winning together

We treat customers as partners rather than as tickets to be closed

We value delivering usable solutions now and iterative refinement over holding out for a perfect solution later

The requirements are intended as a guideline only and it is not necessary to meet them all. If you are a highly motivated person who is interested in jumping into something new, believe you can be a culture add and thrive on driving a challenging program from start to finish, then you should apply.


Understand our Operating Principles; make them the guidelines for how you do your job.

Own the customer experience - think and act in ways that put our customers first, give them seamless digital options at every touchpoint, and make them promoters of our products and services.

Know your stuff - be enthusiastic learners, users and advocates of our game-changing technology, products and services, especially our digital tools and experiences.

Win as a team - make big things happen by working together and being open to new ideas.

Be an active part of the Net Promoter System - a way of working that brings more employee and customer feedback into the company - by joining huddles, making call backs and helping us elevate opportunities to do better for our customers.

Drive results and growth.

Respect and promote inclusion & diversity.

Do what's right for each other, our customers, investors and our communities.

We value critical thinking, self-motivation, and the ability to be successful in an ambiguous and less-structured environment.

We love people who are intellectually curious, use data to make decisions, innovate, elevate the performance of those around them, win as a team, and can express themselves thoughtfully.

We want you to be passionate about delivering a great customer experience and understand how the work you drive connects to the customer.

Outstanding business judgment maximising strong critical thinking complemented with a bias for action and execution/operational excellence.

Excellent analytical problem-solving skills and ability to synthesize data from multiple sources to drive data-driven decisions.

Comfort working in an ambiguous environment, and the ability to build a program from scratch – setting your own plans, targets, objectives, and measurements.

Ability to be “Hands on” – regardless of title, everybody in our team manages programs from top to bottom – meaning from senior executive level stakeholder management down to detailed planning and information management.

An engineering degree is not required, but you must have strong technical capability, passion for technology and innovation, and ability to communicate with technical teams.

Be well versed in industry trends including competitive and market dynamics, and product and technology trends, especially in the Cloud space.

Industry experience solving, investigating, and fixing production issues in large scale Cloud and/or hosted environments.

Experience with software development process (SDLC) and agile/iterative methodologies required.

We do not overweight Comcast experience – this role is not already targeted for an internal applicant, so anybody interested inside or outside of Comcast should apply

Cancer remains a daunting problem despite decades of active research into its molecular causes. Such studies have predominantly focused on the earliest stages of cancer progression such as the formation of a cancer or genes involved in the growth of the primary tumor. In humans afflicted by cancer, the primary tumor is typically surgically resected or eliminated by radiation. Vast numbers of patients, nonetheless die of cancer as a result of metastasis, or the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor site to distal organs. This process is in fact the overwhelming cause of death from cancer and its occurrence changes a patient's prognosis to incurable. Despite its vast clinical significance and inherently fascinating underlying biology, the metastatic program is poorly understood both at the molecular level and at the cellular/tissue micro-environment levels. Our laboratory employs a multi-disciplinary approach involving molecular, biochemical, computational, imaging, and clinical association methods to characterize the critical regulatory pathways that mediate the steps of this process. By implanting human cancer cells obtained from patients with breast or colon cancer into recipient mice, we study and interfere with the various stages of metastasis. By comparing human cancer cells that are highly metastatic to those that fail to metastasize, we have uncovered a set of small RNA molecules (microRNAs) that suppress metastasis. Our future work is aimed at gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms by which these microRNAs block metastasis. Our hope is that a better understanding of this process will enhance our therapeutic arsenal against it.",15d,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=121&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=0000018469991007b43abc0cfa761b0d&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_399875c1&cb=1668219008946&jobListingId=1008239236699&jrtk=3-0-1ghkpi42724u8001-1ghkpi42lj4hn800-07f97c463839ab26-
