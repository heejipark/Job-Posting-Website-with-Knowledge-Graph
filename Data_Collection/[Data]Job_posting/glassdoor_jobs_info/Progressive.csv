Description:
Summary:
The Vulnerability Operations team is a governance team aligned to the Technology Infrastructure and Information Security organizations. The team provides oversight of outstanding enterprise-wide software vulnerabilities and facilitates their rapid research and subsequent closure. The team also owns the policy and regulatory controls surrounding delivery of this service for the company.
Vulnerability remediation demands are communicated to relevant CIO-owned, in-scope teams which execute the work in their specific silos. Because they are focused on their responsibilities and actions, individual application/product teams digest and act on the demand independently of other teams. Any challenges or escalations are done on a team by team basis with little to no ability to share best practices or concerns across the affected teams unless the initiative does so proactively. There are significant efficiency and cost savings opportunities in finding ways to improve information sharing across the in-scope teams and in automating and/or streamlining relevant improvements and guidance for the teams this group leads and supports. Similarly this role can observe challenges to getting the work done and proactively engage necessary parties before an escalation to senior leadership is needed, mitigating noise and churn for already busy teams and leaders.",24h,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=127&ao=1110586&s=58&guid=000001846d18477bafe16d4986298a19&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_8c99cc86&cb=1668277711849&jobListingId=1008275559427&cpc=3BA4CE39D5B5DEF5&jrtk=3-0-1ghmhght3j45t801-1ghmhghtpgsro800-e15f51d714298346--6NYlbfkN0AuKz8EBO1xHDEL7V2YF9xF3dC_I9B9i-Zw2Jh8clPMK3KTieKealHQgtz1auP59MwT3COWhZezjJrKLlGBomPuyGy7lIuvTIKr6u1PSvXTlStT23WrSz9ugVISD9XnakPuEKuTXVN0LrXX40YustFkBrb7ZXF4YB--KgakGl4j0tp5iE9tDS7gKu4yumgu3aE00iA2a77EsxM2yUl_W65TT5GuZ0lc9fItvKj2czxbKpGTrql3WHYPuJAFFuL20wSHfXU8grt2Be8mt8QQsKbfLSV5cO-g_aEQxufSNGOI7Fp-gZD4dlHoERCOjziBBXvACb7vcHhtVuo8Vmkszkx0mUI8a_n6H-Fg0fuGm91yCzXWGJB9rHp0QxH_TtW93LMrEnvFunZRL5Felp54TSHm701_Zkbd94UDmKhlCfHiDy1efynx-gfxCbhBNNmTYr08YKBZDly_Qel1Jr43oNZeto6BoZgBg3yRG44_WiFCsqGGwKmwckk2AHb2QKcU_b5aG7uC0oPyvU2pteZbKlxtJYLPGxcaYLbuJKM75Lyx1gY7hK2UyAqveoX53P7BXvIpOtkmw60P2Fj0xBWJoCk4Bnb8iPX5gyN7-8Wx8uPrBCQK4vF0qYGynWK-AY2NUWMqiDpp8PpN1rtc9W6Q1jU9iEBdlMeG_UPNWHUZohr02PMhbOwH5gc9_UyNvQHwMvm2TNnsQIyTSeUgh4aatYdK41fUtAweiaeQKgLwMAyv4f9bKovhDcDnpnIdklO_K05NOOBIaxwK9x9og2TZQh-RjrLekPMSOrp36MnXUNjuw_XCYcqBHxxwfn3eytkyS3IHqFbvT6uVr7RreRPhP-gFGH_HzZl7aP5NW2jrPPP-GIzb973t9wGozFsMpgVZrDeMAKO8XrhaR37J-a34LiFViqmZW7fXrR4WM2EGxvNHxXFCSXJrDSCf2Hoy48Kp-rDjK3mXGTE_hvM_gblExZUa1DR6eQ2uDpA%3D
