New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.

Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL's science and engineering organizations and Caltech's academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines' languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity's core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions' results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration's challenges.

Our goal is rapid and sustainable growth to become the leading last-minute vacation rental travel marketplace in the world.
Where did the idea for getawayGoGo come from? While managing his vacation rental management company in Southern California, owner Brad den Dulk and his team recognized there was extra marketing effort and systems required to fill their last-minute vacancies. These efforts consisted of price reductions and headline changes on all OTAs, social media specials postings, email newsletter blasts, reservationist discounting, and more. Though effective, these efforts added extra marketing costs and were time-consuming. Also, because of the OTA fees and reduced direct Traveler communication, it became even more challenging to fill last-minute openings. From this experience the concept for a last-minute marketplace, getawayGoGo was created.",30d+,

Rubin Observatory, is the US flagship ground-based astronomical survey of the 2020s. CMU is looking for top-tier and experienced full-stack Systems Software Engineers to work at the intersection of innovative computer science and pioneering astrophysics. The engineers will design and build an analysis framework run on the cloud or high-performance computing (HPC) systems that can store, search, analyze and annotate data of the volume and complexity of the LSST data. This framework will provide an interface for the astronomical community to run real time and batch analyses (e.g. to search for one-in-a-million events in continuous streams of data). Successful engineers will shape, drive and execute this vision to build one of the first scalable science platforms, possibly with long-term consequences for the future of astronomical software.
With an estimated start date in 2024, LSST will generate the deepest-ever, multi-color, 10-year-long movie of the southern sky, detecting 30 billion stars and galaxies and amassing 100 PB of imaging and catalog data. This is part of a trend of ever larger and more sophisticated astronomical imaging surveys: science is at an inflection point where the volume of data and the software infrastructure we use to analyze it can fundamentally change our understanding of the universe. The scientific reach of the LSST will be extraordinary, addressing questions such as: how did the Solar System form; what governs the birth and death of stars; how does dark matter sculpt the shape of our Galaxy; will an asteroid devastate the Earth in the next century; what is the nature of the dark energy that drives the expansion of our Universe? At the same time, the data volumes will push the limits of current algorithms and computer science technologies. The software team that you will be part of will begin by developing software for direct and immediate scientific application to astronomical data from existing surveys, scaling up to the data volume and complexity of LSST in 3 years.
