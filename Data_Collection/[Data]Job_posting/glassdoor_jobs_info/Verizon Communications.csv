DISH is a Fortune 200 company that continues to redefine the communications industry. Our legacy is innovation and a willingness to challenge the status quo, including reinventing ourselves. We disrupted the pay-TV industry in the mid-90s with the launch of the DISH satellite TV service, taking on some of the largest U.S. corporations in the process, and grew to be the fourth-largest pay-TV provider. We are doing it again with the first live, internet-delivered TV service – Sling TV – that bucks traditional pay-TV norms and gives consumers a truly new way to access and watch television.

Now we have our sights set on upending the wireless industry and unseating the entrenched incumbent carriers.

We are driven by curiosity, pride, adventure, and a desire to win – it’s in our DNA. We’re looking for people with boundless energy, intelligence, and an overwhelming need to achieve, to join our team as we embark on the next chapter of our story.

Do it here.

Fueled by the Verizon 5G future, the New Business Incubation team is anchored in Verizon’s Corporate Strategy organization with a mission to scale new software automation businesses fueled by the power of the 5G future. This unique charter, paired with the strength of Verizon’s best-in-class network, broad customer base and massive technological capabilities, puts the New Business Incubation team at the forefront of innovation as we embark on the 5G future.

Comprised of passionate and forward-thinking leaders, the New Business Incubation team includes ecosystem builders and industry experts in location technology, robotics, digital twins, fleet management, energy transformation, industrial IoT and other emergent technologies. With a belief that the autonomous future sits at the intersection of intelligent networking, devices and software, the team is working to shepherd customers through their digitization journeys to enable the connection, management and operation of physical and digital elements needed for the Industry 4.0 future. The combination of these technologies will transform Industry to deliver new levels of efficiency, intelligence and business outcomes in productivity, experiences and safety.

The Investment Strategy Manager is responsible for developing cohesive and comprehensive investment theses to drive tactical investment decisions around net-new, above-the-network opportunities.

The role will require collaborating cross-functionally with other strategists, researchers, product managers, engineers, and our Verizon Ventures team to craft these end-to-end investment strategies that position Verizon to capitalize on new ecosystems that will be enabled by 5G, whether through passive minority investments, active lead investments, joint ventures, partnerships, or internal IP creation and commercialization. The innovation process is never a straight line though, so you will need to continuously learn, analyze, and refine the opportunity through progressive strategy iterations and taking ownership over the path to getting a return on investment.

Verizon is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services, transforming the way we connect across the globe. We’re a diverse network of people driven by our shared ambition to shape a better future. Here, we have the ability to learn and grow at the speed of technology, and the space to create within every role. Together, we are moving the world forward – and you can too. Dream it. Build it. Do it here.


What you’ll be doing...

As the Senior Manager - Immersive Experiences Product Area Tech Lead, you will be responsible for developing and executing a strategy to accelerate and catalyze the Corporate Systems Group (CSG) Innovation Ecosystem delivering value to our corporate partners, employees, and Verizon. You will take the long-term view to identify where CSG can be constructively disruptive through strategic partnerships and investment in emergent technologies that will provide future ready solutions to complex corporate problems.

Comprised of passionate and forward-thinking leaders, the CSG Emerging Technology & Digital Innovation (ET&I) team you will join includes ecosystem builders and industry experts in hyperautomation, process mining, Blockchain, digital twins, industrial IoT, AI, ML and other emergent technologies. With a belief that the autonomous future sits at the intersection of intelligent networking, devices and software, the team is working to shepherd internal corporate business partners through their digitization journeys to enable the connection, management and operation of physical and digital elements needed for future ready enterprise operations. The combination of these technologies will transform corporate enterprise landscapes to deliver new levels of efficiency, intelligence and business outcomes in productivity, experiences and compliance.

You will be working across various teams within CSG and broader Verizon to ensure our strategy is well understood and aligned with Verizon’s growth initiatives. You will collaborate with other strategists, researchers, product managers, engineers, and our Global Technology Solutions team to craft these end-to-end investment strategies that position CSG to capitalize on new ecosystems, whether through applied research, proof of concept development, incubation of disruptive ideas, internal and external partnerships, or internal IP creation and federation.

The innovation process is never a straight line though, so you will need to continuously learn, analyze, and refine the Immersive Experience opportunity through progressive strategy iterations and taking ownership over the path to getting a return on investment.

Verizon is a leading provider of technology, communications, information and entertainment products, transforming the way we connect across the globe. We’re a diverse network of people driven by our ambition and united in our shared purpose to shape a better future. Here, we have the ability to learn and grow at the speed of technology, and the space to create within every role. Together, we are moving the world forward – and you can too. Dream it. Build it. Do it here.

Fueled by the Verizon 5G future, the New Business Incubation team is anchored in Verizon’s Corporate Strategy organization with a mission to scale new software automation businesses fueled by the power of the 5G future. This unique charter, paired with the strength of Verizon’s best-in-class network, broad customer base and massive technological capabilities, puts the New Business Incubation team at the forefront of innovation as we embark on the 5G future.

Comprised of passionate and forward-thinking leaders, the New Business Incubation team includes ecosystem builders and industry experts in location technology, robotics, digital twins, fleet management, energy transformation, industrial IoT and other emergent technologies. With a belief that the autonomous future sits at the intersection of intelligent networking, devices and software, the team is working to shepherd customers through their digitization journeys to enable the connection, management and operation of physical and digital elements needed for the Industry 4.0 future. The combination of these technologies will transform Industry to deliver new levels of efficiency, intelligence and business outcomes in productivity, experiences and safety.

The Investment Strategy Manager is responsible for developing cohesive and comprehensive investment theses to drive tactical investment decisions around net-new, above-the-network opportunities. From our long funnel of hypothesized 5G use cases and concept hypotheses, this person will be responsible for selecting new areas of focus and then iteratively developing and refining a detailed investment strategy based on deep dives into evolving customer needs, available technology, competitive dynamics, market size, financial return profile, and strategic alignment, among other factors.

The role will require collaborating cross-functionally with other strategists, researchers, product managers, engineers, and our Verizon Ventures team to craft these end-to-end investment strategies that position Verizon to capitalize on new ecosystems that will be enabled by 5G, whether through passive minority investments, active lead investments, joint ventures, partnerships, or internal IP creation and commercialization. The innovation process is never a straight line though, so you will need to continuously learn, analyze, and refine the opportunity through progressive strategy iterations and taking ownership over the path to getting a return on investment.


Where you’ll be working:

In this hybrid role, you'll have a defined work location that includes work from home and assigned office days set by your manager.




You are adaptable, curious, humble, and have a bias towards data-driven experimentation. You invent novel approaches, find patterns, validate hypotheses objectively, and demonstrate continuous personal development along the way. You thrive in the unknown and find extreme comfort in the grey.

You’ll need to have:


Even better if you have one or more of the following:

As the Senior Manager - Immersive Experiences Product Area Tech Lead, you will be responsible for developing and executing a strategy to accelerate and catalyze the Corporate Systems Group (CSG) Innovation Ecosystem delivering value to our corporate partners, employees, and Verizon.

Comprised of passionate and forward-thinking leaders, the CSG Emerging Technology & Digital Innovation (ET&I) team you will join includes ecosystem builders and industry experts in hyperautomation, process mining, Blockchain, digital twins, industrial IoT, AI, ML and other emergent technologies. With a belief that the autonomous future sits at the intersection of intelligent networking, devices and software, the team is working to shepherd internal corporate business partners through their digitization journeys to enable the connection, management and operation of physical and digital elements needed for future ready enterprise operations. The combination of these technologies will transform corporate enterprise landscapes to deliver new levels of efficiency, intelligence and business outcomes in productivity, experiences and compliance.

You will be working across various teams within CSG and broader Verizon to ensure our strategy is well understood and aligned with Verizon’s growth initiatives.
