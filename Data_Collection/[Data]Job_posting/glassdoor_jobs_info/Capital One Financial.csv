Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

To solve this problem, we expanded into software and built integrated solutions to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

What you’ll be doing...

Verizon is a leading provider of technology, communications, information and entertainment products, transforming the way we connect across the globe. We’re a diverse network of people driven by our ambition and united in our shared purpose to shape a better future. Here, we have the ability to learn and grow at the speed of technology, and the space to create within every role. Together, we are moving the world forward – and you can too. Dream it. Build it. Do it here.

Fueled by the Verizon 5G future, the New Business Incubation team is anchored in Verizon’s Corporate Strategy organization with a mission to scale new software automation businesses fueled by the power of the 5G future. This unique charter, paired with the strength of Verizon’s best-in-class network, broad customer base and massive technological capabilities, puts the New Business Incubation team at the forefront of innovation as we embark on the 5G future.

Comprised of passionate and forward-thinking leaders, the New Business Incubation team includes ecosystem builders and industry experts in location technology, robotics, digital twins, fleet management, energy transformation, industrial IoT and other emergent technologies. With a belief that the autonomous future sits at the intersection of intelligent networking, devices and software, the team is working to shepherd customers through their digitization journeys to enable the connection, management and operation of physical and digital elements needed for the Industry 4.0 future. The combination of these technologies will transform Industry to deliver new levels of efficiency, intelligence and business outcomes in productivity, experiences and safety.

The Investment Strategy Manager is responsible for developing cohesive and comprehensive investment theses to drive tactical investment decisions around net-new, above-the-network opportunities.

The role will require collaborating cross-functionally with other strategists, researchers, product managers, engineers, and our Verizon Ventures team to craft these end-to-end investment strategies that position Verizon to capitalize on new ecosystems that will be enabled by 5G, whether through passive minority investments, active lead investments, joint ventures, partnerships, or internal IP creation and commercialization.

We set them. Job Summary:
The Digital Incubator Director is responsible for defining, delivering, and managing the lifecycle of transformative ideas as they are incubated (and eventually accelerated to market) at Allstate. The Digital Incubator Director will provide guidance and coaching to Allstate employees with transformative ideas to maximize the customer and enterprise value of the ideas; or, work with them to kill them quickly.

They will ensure that ideas brought to fruition are well-positioned to be accelerated by Allstate into the market once they meet that high bar for market entry. Key Responsibilities:
Establish and improve the operating processes for the SparkTank Incubator, including idea intake, prioritization, stagegates with criteria to proceed, funding release, measurement, graduation from incubation into an acceleration phase, and outcome tracking
Lead the process to select and onboard intrapreneurs, ideas, and opportunities according to the prioritization criteria and onboarding processes
Mentor Allstate employees who are going through the incubation process, and connect them to other critical Allstate and external stakeholders who can coach and support them
Lead and direct the small core of dedicated SparkTank Incubator resources (e.g., analysts, engineers, solutionists) to ensure that each idea is given the right support and capacity at the right time
Build relationships across other critical partners who will be side-by-side with the SparkTank Incubator to drive execution and shape ideas—including D3, ATSV, marketing, PSID, R&D, finance, and risk—to ensure that the best of Allstate is represented
Lead the stage gate process to ensure that ideas are passed quickly and funded from gate to gate, or killed rapidly and learned from
Build relationships with key business leaders who might eventually “own” an idea being incubated; ensure alignment to these leaders to get the right integration and input as ideas are developed, as well as to prepare the leader to sponsor the idea
Design and lead critical governance processes, including KPIs for reporting and risk management activities
Convene the right set of sponsors around critical incubation governance activities including funding release and outcome tracking
Coach and develop the small core of dedicated SparkTank Incubator resources, crafting compelling development paths and growth opportunities

"['Bloomberg', '4.1']",http://www.bloomberg.com/,Senior Project Engineer,"Sacramento, CA",$74K - $138K (Employer est.),"Bloomberg is all about putting data in the hands of decision makers. We bring together data from across the globe in real time and present it to our customers through the Bloomberg Terminal. However, in this increasingly connected digital world, our customers need to bring data into their own applications through data feeds and APIs.

Web API Gateway supports hundreds of API projects that unlock financial data for clients across the global capital markets. Our engineers are responsible for the infrastructure that authenticates and routes Web API requests at scale, and we build tools to support both our API product teams and clients using these APIs. As a critical and strategic part of Bloomberg connectivity infrastructure, our platform runs at extremely low latency with high availability and reliability.

Our stakeholders
We build our product to be used by external Enterprise customers and our tools to be used by internal business stakeholders and teams across the whole of Bloomberg engineering.


We develop our software using a combination of open source, third-party and in-house technologies. As engineers, we try to balance using the best technology fit to solve a problem while managing the risk of using exploratory technologies. The problem domains we regularly encounter are:



Some of the specific technologies we have in use today are: Python, Golang, Nginx, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, Redis, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, and ReactJS.

Our APIs are built around open standards such as OpenAPI and websockets, and GraphQL. We assess the strengths and tradeoffs of each, and we're exploring new support for standards like gRPC, AsyncAPI, and more.


Our teams use a version of the Scrum framework tailored to their own team needs. We collaborate to deliver projects as a team and prioritize our joint success over individual achievements. Our engineers develop locally and use an internally hosted github with a pull request workflow for SDLC. Our teams have a high degree of influence over our project roadmap, and you'll benefit from working closely with other experienced engineers and product counterparts.

Since 2021 we have adopted a flexible hybrid model for working from home. We have team days where we work from our office locations, selected by each team to best suit their needs. We believe this approach helps to facilitate collaboration, building consensus and team building.

What is the role?
We are currently seeking motivated infrastructure and API engineers with expertise in building and scaling high-performance backend services and distributed systems to join our rapidly growing team. The Web API Gateway team leverages open source technologies to build runtime components that process millions of requests. We also build valuable relationships across Bloomberg as we engage with dozens of teams during the entire product lifecycle of their API.

As a member of our Web API Gateway engineering team, you will be responsible for the design, development, support and improvement of all Web API infrastructure and related tooling. You will build elastic and fault-tolerant services that can ensure high efficiency under heavy volume over our large-scale distributed systems and network. You'll also design, build and maintain API services to manage configuration, onboarding, and self-service capabilities in collaboration with team members responsible for building our internal and client-facing self service web applications.


Most importantly, we are looking for smart enthusiastic problem solvers who are interested to learn and succeed as a team. Experience and skills in some of the problem domains we regularly encounter (mentioned above) would also be valuable.

If you only meet some of the requirements for this role, that's okay. We value a diverse range of backgrounds and ideas and believe this is fundamental for our future success. We also believe that a strong engineer can pick up any programming language with some ramp up time. So, if you have an interest in the technical domain and the problems we solve, and curiosity to learn and willingness to teach what you know, we'd love to hear from you


We require that you have 3+ years of full-time engineering experience as well as relevant bootcamp experience or a BA, BS, MS, PhD in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering or related technology field.


Bloomberg is an equal opportunity employer, and we value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of age, ancestry, color, gender identity or expression, genetic predisposition or carrier status, marital status, national or ethnic origin, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, sexual and other reproductive health decisions, parental or caring status, physical or mental disability, pregnancy or maternity/parental leave, protected veteran status, status as a victim of domestic violence, or any other classification protected by applicable law.

Bloomberg is a disability inclusive employer. Please let us know if you require any reasonable adjustments to be made for the recruitment process. If you would prefer to discuss this confidentially, please email amer_recruit@bloomberg.net.

The COVID crisis and the uprising for racial justice have shone national light on both the urgent work required to build a more just and vibrant society for all Americans and the potential for positive action when our communities mobilize. In most cases, these efforts are spearheaded by nonprofits, community organizations, and their heroic staff who deliver essential services like affordable housing, social justice advocacy, health, youth development, and the arts. Yet these nonprofits and the communities they support operate within a flawed, inequitable funding system that controls their access to resources, impeding their ability to make a difference.
Nonprofit Finance Fund (NFF) is setting out to change that. We know that nonprofit leaders have power when they have access to capital and financial knowledge. Our strategy focuses on helping to shift that power by changing funding and financing practices so more money flows equitably and with less restriction to community-centered organizations led by and serving people of color, so they can be the drivers of their own change.

Lead Back End Software Engineer - Capital One Software (Remote Eligible)
Capital One has taken a bold journey to build a technology company, while operating in a complex, highly regulated business. We have built out a large engineering organization, moved to the cloud, re-architected our applications and data platforms, and embraced machine learning at scale. Our AI/ML capabilities are now at the forefront of what’s possible in banking. (e.g., Eno)
As we uncovered new challenges along the way, we built and battle tested new capabilities to meet those needs. We’ve open sourced several of the software tools we built (e.g., Cloud Custodian, Hygieia) and forged new partnerships with other digital leaders (e.g., MSFT).
We've developed a suite of internal solutions uniquely designed to meet the challenges of a digital-first, cloud-first business at scale. Today, the Capital One Software team is exploring how these internal solutions across cloud, data, governance, and applications could serve the needs of other companies born or built in the cloud.

Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses. When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.
