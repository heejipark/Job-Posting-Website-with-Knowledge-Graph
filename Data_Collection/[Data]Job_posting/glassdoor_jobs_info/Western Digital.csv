Do you find yourself constantly looking for more and better information? Do you want a job where you can use your knowledge and research skills to improve national security? Never has the role of an all source analyst been so meaningful. More connected devices, larger storage capacity, and faster connections have resulted in an explosion of available information. The problem facing the intelligence community is no longer how to get more data – it’s understanding how to turn the data they have into answers. That’s where you come in. With critical thinking and flexibility, you quickly seek out accurate data sources, sift through the raw data and turn it into valuable intelligence. If you have strong analytical skills and a problem-solving mindset, we have an opportunity to use those skills to protect our national security.
As an all source analyst on our team, you’ll explore new data sources, create effective queries, and combine information from disparate sources to help your client understand their mission environment. You’ll learn how to validate the information and apply client tradecraft as you help build assessments for senior policymakers. This is a chance to grow your expertise in researching, drafting, and publishing time-sensitive threat assessments. You’ll develop new skills in classified and unclassified research and draft and publish intelligence assessments. Evaluate entities investing in US and Western technology and markets for threats to US national security. Understand technology and evaluate counterintelligence threats. Support and engage in continuing dialogue with analysts across the intelligence community (IC) and key personnel in the policy, military, and law enforcement communities on issues associated with foreign acquisitions and investment security. Work with analysts and supervisors at all levels and across several agencies to find and forge consensus on complex and frequently contentious issues. We focus on growing as a team to deliver the best support to our customers, so you’ll have resources for mentoring and learning new skills and tools. Join us as we provide the right information at the right time to support the critical needs of our policymakers.

BAE Systems is seeking an exceptional Systems Engineer for an exciting opportunity to support the Air Force's acquisition of the next generation Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) system, known as the Sentinel ICBM Program.

The Sentinel Program (formerly GBSD) is an enormous and complex “Mega-Project” modernizing the entire ICBM weapon system deployed across tens of thousands of square miles in five states. Without a doubt, Sentinel is one of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) most important acquisition efforts for the next decade, if not longer. It includes a complete refurbishment or replacement of hundreds of aging Minuteman III ICBM facilities to secure and support a newly designed, technologically advanced ballistic missile. It will also provide an entirely new command and control system (including an updated airborne launch capability) as well as vast array of required support equipment specifically engineered to operate and sustain the new weapon system over the decades ahead. Sentinel is one of the DoD’s newest official “programs of record,” having recently achieved Acquisitions Milestone B and enjoys broad, strong support at the national level. It is a long-term project with the weapon system anticipated to deploy over a nine-year period beginning in 2026 and remaining operational until at least 2075. Sentinel is a career defining program that will present unique and challenging opportunities that are simply not available with smaller projects.


This position will directly support the Sentinel Program’s Command & Launch (C&L) Division as they acquire the weapon system command & control capabilities for the next generation ICBM. Duties will include providing expert advice and support to Sentinel program leaders on all command & control aspects throughout the acquisition cycle. Areas of responsibility that fall under the C&L Team include:
Specifically, this C&L team member will be responsible for supporting the government customer in the review, and assessment of Sentinel prime contractor’s designs, documentation, architectures, and Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) products in order to meet Sentinel acquisition requirements and timelines. Our team provides expertise on weapon system and lab architectures; concepts of operation; modeling, simulation and analysis (MS&A); and plans for addressing command & control integration options. This team member will also coordinate and integrate actions with other program managers, engineers, logisticians, system testers, and external agencies. Our current team includes staff with extensive expertise in the Minuteman III weapon system (including the Airborne Launch Control System) and actively participates in ongoing studies and assessments for this next generation ICBM system.





BAE Systems is the third largest defense contractor in the world with an exceptional, mission-focused culture. The 800+ BAE Systems employees and sub-contractors located at Hill Air Force Base, Utah are closely aligned to the United States Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center.

We are a uniquely-valued mission partner delivering daily technical excellence and innovative solutions to our government customers. BAE Systems has earned accolades as a “Top Workplace” in Utah based on employee feedback for four consecutive years, earning special distinction for providing a healthy work-life balance for our valued employees.

Departmental Overview

Standing nearly on top of the Hayward Fault, the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (BSL) provides robust hazard information while engaging in essential geophysical research. Throughout the BSL's long history of innovation , beginning with the 1897 installation of the first seismograph in the western hemisphere, our commitment to probing the Earth's deepest secrets has remained unchanged.

Today, the BSL operates several different networks and has expanded into a broader range of geophysical monitoring. Data from these geophysical networks are recorded digitally and are archived at the Northern California Earthquake Data Center, which is located at the Berkeley Seismological Lab. Researchers from around the world use data from the BSL. In addition to their use in earthquake studies, these data are useful for rapid notification of earthquakes. Together with the USGS Menlo Park, the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory reports earthquake information within a few minutes of occurrence. Our lab also acts as part of a statewide earthquake monitoring system, the California Integrated Seismic Network.

BSL operates a network of geophysical observatories throughout Northern California and Southern Oregon. These seismic or geodetic observatories send near real time data to our datacenters and are used for research purposes and a new earthquake early warning system called ""ShakeAlert"".

This position involves professional engineering and engineering technician support as part of academic instructional lab and/or research projects and programs. Engineering activities include the design, construction, testing of experimental systems, operation of analytical systems, establishment of performance specifications, and documentation. Engineering Technicians may be assigned duties within a single discipline (e.g., electrical) or span a range of disciplines [Note: for machine specialty work in a research or lab setting, see Research and Laboratory Job Field, Lab Mechanician Job Family].

1) Be involved in the locating, planning, permitting, construction, installation and maintenance of new and existing observatories; 2) Ensure that produced data is being telemetered property and data meets quality specifications; 3) troubleshoot and repair complex issues at remote observatories.

This position involves supporting research efforts within the department and partner agencies. Activities span a wide range of disciplines, including but not limited to, power systems, analog and digital circuits, construction & fabrication, computer networking, planning, and documenting. A working knowledge of Windows, Mac, Unix, and Linux operating systems is desirable. These task are done under the supervision of management and/or senior engineers.

Many tasks are expected to be completed with little or no support or supervision in very remote settings. Work is often performed in extreme conditions such as rain, snow, heat, cold, high winds, etc. The position involves overnight travel up to 50% of the time.

Some remote sites utilize a private microwave radio system to telemeter data. Repairing this equipment often requires work at remote radio tower sites. This position involves climbing radio towers to remove and replace equipment. The employee will be trained and certified and appropriate equipment will be provided.

BSL Employees routinely interact with the public and are required to exhibit a high level of professionalism and judgement. This includes interfacing with public and private property owner and various stakeholders in the public and private sectors.
