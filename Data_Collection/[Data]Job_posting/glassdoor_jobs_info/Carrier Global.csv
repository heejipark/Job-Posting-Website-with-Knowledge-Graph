"['Bloomberg', '4.1']",http://www.bloomberg.com/,On-Site Reverse Logistics Coordinator (8565-4),Eastvale,$49K - $76K (Glassdoor est.),"Who are we:
Bloomberg is the global leader in business and financial data, news, and insights. Using the power of technology, we connect the world's decision-makers to accurate information on the financial markets and help them make faster, smarter decisions.

What is the challenge:
Finance is changing, and fast; financial professionals are increasingly relying on the power of APIs and creating their own models and analytics. Bloomberg offers a unified data query system that makes it significantly easier to perform complex cross-dataset queries efficiently. We have thousands of clients with varying needs and sophistication who use this query mechanism across our Terminal, Excel, and Python products. We want to radically improve the user experience of our clients by learning from current pain points and leveraging recent improvements to our technology.


We are looking for an experienced UX Researcher-Designer with a passion for understanding complex tasks and user needs and then translating their findings into designs to make complex interactive systems usable and valuable. This position requires a strong foundation in user-centered research and design methods and the ability to communicate design decisions effectively to senior stakeholders and colleagues.

You will play a pivotal role in all aspects of the product design process: understanding our users' needs through empirical and analytic research; journey mapping and storyboarding to build consensus around the vision and evaluating it; and then designing the detailed interaction and measuring its success.


Your colleagues will be experienced leaders in HCI and UX as well as Product, engineering, and SME partners in San Francisco, New York, and London. UX and Product reside within our Chief Technology Officer (CTO) group in San Francisco, which incubates our most strategic and long-term projects. This structure ensures that UX is the driver of the product vision and has buy-in from the highest levels of Bloomberg's leadership.


Your portfolio of work is of great interest to us. We want to explore two representative projects thoroughly, including problem definition, user research, design exploration, and execution. Ideal projects to share with us should showcase - in detail - your use of various research and design methods to understand and solve the problem. Consider including artifacts that illustrate your experience with user research, personas, journey maps, task flows, sketches/wireframes, storyboards, etc.

Please include a link to your portfolio in your application. If you need some other way of showing us your work, please apply for the role and we'll contact you to make arrangements to view it. Please do not, without proper consent, share or disclose to Bloomberg any confidential or proprietary information that you may have obtained in connection with employment with any other employer or which may be considered the Work Product of any other individual or entity.


Apply if you think we're a good match and we'll get in touch with you to let you know the next steps. In the meantime, check out these links:
