We're growing the right way, and we need exceptional talent to help us build upon our successful story.
Talroo is helping organizations like Uber, McDonald's, UPS, The Home Depot, Target and more, find and hire their essential workforces.

Rather than drive customers to a destination site, Talroo uses a consumer marketing approach to deliver job opportunities to candidates where they are already spending time online. Similar to what Google AdSense and Facebook Ad Networks do for their advertisers, Talroo uncovers the right candidates that companies are looking to hire.

Talroo leverages a search-and-match algorithm powered by state-of-the-art AI technologies.
