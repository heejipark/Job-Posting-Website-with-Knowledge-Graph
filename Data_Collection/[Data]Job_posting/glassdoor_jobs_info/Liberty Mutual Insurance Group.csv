For too long, cities have treated streets simply as conduits for vehicles. Traffic has been viewed as something to be ‘optimized’ while sprawling urban development and ever-larger vehicles have created City streets that are antagonistic to active transportation modes of walking, biking, transit, and micro-mobility. As a City known for its outdoor activities and amenities, Roanoke understands the need to create an aesthetically pleasing and equitable transportation system where all users have access to safe, reliable, and affordable modes of transportation – including those modes based around human physical activity.

To that end, Roanoke’s Transportation Division focuses upon maintaining and improving the City’s green and gray infrastructure assets within the right-of-way including approximately 1100 lane miles of asphalt pavement; 300 miles of sidewalk including 2,800 ADA ramps; 40 miles of on-street bike lanes; 350 acres of maintained/landscaped right-of-way; 380 alleys used for Solid Waste collection; and over 400 pieces of outdoor power equipment.

This position will lead and manage Transportation Division’s Field Operations program including 35 full-time and 15 seasonal employees responsible for: inspection, repair, maintenance, and in-house construction of both green and gray assets within the public Right-of-Way, including snow removal program, as well as outdoor power equipment repair services, while working as a part of the Public Works – Transportation Division team.

Roanoke, Virginia is a unique locality with amenities that you would expect from a dynamic urban center, without losing the charm of a small town.

"['City of Roanoke', '3.6']",http://www.roanokeva.gov/,Data Cybersecurity Engineer,Remote,$90K - $126K (Employer est.),"Description
For too long, cities have treated streets simply as conduits for vehicles. Traffic has been viewed as something to be ‘optimized’ while sprawling urban development and ever-larger vehicles have created City streets that are antagonistic to active transportation modes of walking, biking, transit, and micro-mobility. As a City known for its outdoor activities and amenities, Roanoke understands the need to create an aesthetically pleasing and equitable transportation system where all users have access to safe, reliable, and affordable modes of transportation – including those modes based around human physical activity.

To that end, Roanoke’s Transportation Division focuses upon maintaining and improving the City’s green and gray infrastructure assets within the right-of-way including approximately 1100 lane miles of asphalt pavement; 300 miles of sidewalk including 2,800 ADA ramps; 40 miles of on-street bike lanes; 350 acres of maintained/landscaped right-of-way; 380 alleys used for Solid Waste collection; and over 400 pieces of outdoor power equipment.

This position will lead and manage Transportation Division’s Field Operations program including 35 full-time and 15 seasonal employees responsible for: inspection, repair, maintenance, and in-house construction of both green and gray assets within the public Right-of-Way, including snow removal program, as well as outdoor power equipment repair services, while working as a part of the Public Works – Transportation Division team.

Roanoke, Virginia is a unique locality with amenities that you would expect from a dynamic urban center, without losing the charm of a small town. Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains with hiking and mountain bike trails, rivers, lakes, and snow skiing nearby, the City of Roanoke is one of the area’s largest employers offering competitive health and dental benefits, life insurance, and retirement pension plans. Employees may also choose to participate in optional benefits including a deferred compensation plan and flexible spending account through payroll deduction",30d+,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=112&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=000001846d14fad7acff2cdebda54b48&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_a6dd5c97&cb=1668277442107&jobListingId=1007262800810&jrtk=3-0-1ghmh9uockf2l801-1ghmh9uoui38g800-89e322738cae3d3f-
