As a Lead Engineer, you serve as the technical anchor for the engineering team that supports a product. You create, own and are responsible for the application architecture that best serves the product in its functional and non-functional needs. You identify and drive architectural changes to accelerate feature development or improve the quality of service (or both). You have deep and broad engineering skills and are capable of standing up an architecture in its whole on your own, but you choose to influence a wider team by acting as a “force multiplier”.",4d,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=127&ao=1110586&s=58&guid=000001846ad895a2876583104f090757&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_1d74c023&cb=1668239967608&jobListingId=1008263825870&cpc=3BA4CE39D5B5DEF5&jrtk=3-0-1ghldh5ef2a83001-1ghldh5f6i15p800-99f7ad3e90c3186a--6NYlbfkN0AgONBeCfCTVljpwzR96jFX3mtyFC--n153CYnqiKkqIbEzGownH_L0_wgVvmdp1a1WlElguwq7b9MiTaDrryEW7A4pKoZ2G6h_OVwh6vA3vzzRhY8JaIYHP_IALWj8rx-AskD_0loe8hoDb42FFscja1abV7cwk6SopUmaVO5tKWjSE5w5VLwd3Im9dz_F-_qEmOHEM-8O6IOBqqlqAykEVWSXfZoamPFpM14yeB63vtcFw1DCCR75kdjgWZasznzCAVOwgUwxLCaaqCeYvrNPV5jmWW-2_-YtkLxIQgzxwUgDTZt3SOYyZimCLag57DN4As01PEl4fhUDFOYSLrwF-7UrCHEyj--P2D3T2OvR3p-W0m9-WIv1FVduexQ5eizxwXypJvt0V59OuAdd1Yx6kmjc0_0tfvoPW_iuZh1RPdNlkmjc_ET6

Your responsibilities will include enhancing the capabilities of a relatively new deployment of Jamf to meet our usability, telemetry, and security needs.
This includes defining and implementing the interfaces that different Dropboxers use in their day-to-day computing environment.
For most of the company that means creating a robust and useful Self Service portal For our internal support team, that means an interface that empowers them to solve problems and unblock Dropboxers whose work is impacted by an issue For our organization, that means creating an interface that hosts telemetry data that verifies the integrity and security of every system in our fleet And, for the CPE team, that means leveraging Jamf s more advanced capabilities to create an engineering workflow that bridges the gap between source control and deployment automation By joining Dropbox you ll have a specific role to fill, and will collaborate with a number of cross-functional teams to deliver high impact services to Dropboxers across the entire company.
Initially, there s a lot of foundational work to be done.
Over time, we expect that the problem sets will become less foundational and more advanced requiring more detailed data-driven analysis and review to inform decision-making.
We can t promise that it ll be easy, but we can promise that it ll be a lot of fun and you ll both learn a lot and teach us a lot along the way, too.

For example, Python, Ruby, or Swift Five years experience using source control, such as git, with CI/CD integrations for systems management applications One to three years experience writing and/or designing systems written in Swift, Objective-C, or another combination of languages Excellent presentation and writing skills to both technical and non-technical audiences in a remote environment A bachelor's degree in any field of study or equivalent post-secondary experience providing a depth and breadth of reading, writing, and problem solving experience.
Total Rewards At Dropbox, we strive to be a great place for all Dropboxers to grow and be recognized for that growth.
This job posting reflects broad requirements, and represents two potential levels of role.
Through our assessment process, we will identify your level that ties to compensation based on your experience and technical expertise along with the scope of the role.
For candidates hired in Colorado, the expected salary/On-Target Earnings (OTE) range for the role is $107,400 - $126,400 - $145,400 if you are assessed at the IC3 level.
If you are instead assessed at the IC4 level, the expected salary/On-Target Earnings (OTE) range for the role is $124,500 - $146,500 - $168,500.
This salary/OTE range represents the low, middle, and high end of the salary or OTE (Sales roles) range for this position, and is subject to change.
To determine a Dropboxer s starting pay we carefully consider a variety of factors, including primary work location and an evaluation of a candidate s skills, experience, market demands, and internal parity.

Initially, there s a lot of foundational work to be done.
Over time, we expect that the problem sets will become less foundational and more advanced requiring more detailed data-driven analysis and review to inform decision-making.
We can t promise that it ll be easy, but we can promise that it ll be a lot of fun and you ll both learn a lot and teach us a lot along the way, too.

As the world moves beyond mandatory work from home Dropbox is taking bold action to embrace Virtual First; a new work from anywhere paradigm.
That means our MacBooks the systems that you administer as our newest client platform engineer are Dropbox s new workplace, making what you do the foundation of how we facilitate a new workplace culture at Dropbox.
Your responsibilities will include enhancing the capabilities of a relatively new deployment of Jamf to meet our usability, telemetry, and security needs.
This includes defining and implementing the interfaces that different Dropboxers use in their day-to-day computing environment.
For most of the company that means creating a robust and useful Self Service portal For our internal support team, that means an interface that empowers them to solve problems and unblock Dropboxers whose work is impacted by an issue For our organization, that means creating an interface that hosts telemetry data that verifies the integrity and security of every system in our fleet And, for the CPE team, that means leveraging Jamf s more advanced capabilities to create an engineering workflow that bridges the gap between source control and deployment automation By joining Dropbox you ll have a specific role to fill, and will collaborate with a number of cross-functional teams to deliver high impact services to Dropboxers across the entire company.
Initially, there s a lot of foundational work to be done.
Over time, we expect that the problem sets will become less foundational and more advanced requiring more detailed data-driven analysis and review to inform decision-making.
We can t promise that it ll be easy, but we can promise that it ll be a lot of fun and you ll both learn a lot and teach us a lot along the way, too.
Responsibilities Perform integrations and automations that make Dropboxer's Macs easier to use for their day-to-day work Build and maintain desktop applications that enhance Dropboxer s user experience Proactively expand subject mastery by prioritizing continuing education through independent study, educational programs, and conference attendance Keep current on Apple and Jamf's latest product developments, capabilities, and bugs, as well as, familiarity with the competitive landscape of tooling for macOS management Plan and implement solutions for organizational problems within a company-wide cadence that cascades from annual plan, to quarterly Objective and Key Results, to 2 week sprints Assist with researching and reviewing project statements of work by identifing dependencies and prerequisites Proactively update management on deadlines, deliverables, and requirements to maintain accurate forecasting as new information is discovered Act as the technical lead for projects assigned by management Represent the Workplace Experience Team's macOS platform expertise within Dropbox's corporate environment Draft and edit documentation as part of project deliverables and keep it up-to-date with current state Cultivate cross-functional relationships with other organizations within Dropbox Model and promote a can-do, high energy, inclusive workplace that cultivates everyone's talents, strengths, curiosity, and creativity Requirements Certification in Jamf 200 or equivalent experience that demonstrates mastery of the knowledge domains covered by that certification Five years of experience shell scripting to automate systems administration workloads Five years experience working with web APIs to integrate communications between server services using a programming or scripting language other than the shell.
For example, Python, Ruby, or Swift Five years experience using source control, such as git, with CI/CD integrations for systems management applications One to three years experience writing and/or designing systems written in Swift, Objective-C, or another combination of languages Excellent presentation and writing skills to both technical and non-technical audiences in a remote environment A bachelor's degree in any field of study or equivalent post-secondary experience providing a depth and breadth of reading, writing, and problem solving experience.
Total Rewards At Dropbox, we strive to be a great place for all Dropboxers to grow and be recognized for that growth.
This job posting reflects broad requirements, and represents two potential levels of role.
Through our assessment process, we will identify your level that ties to compensation based on your experience and technical expertise along with the scope of the role.
For candidates hired in Colorado, the expected salary/On-Target Earnings (OTE) range for the role is $107,400 - $126,400 - $145,400 if you are assessed at the IC3 level.
If you are instead assessed at the IC4 level, the expected salary/On-Target Earnings (OTE) range for the role is $124,500 - $146,500 - $168,500.
This salary/OTE range represents the low, middle, and high end of the salary or OTE (Sales roles) range for this position, and is subject to change.

As the world moves beyond mandatory work from home Dropbox is taking bold action to embrace Virtual First; a new work from anywhere paradigm.
That means our MacBooks the systems that you administer as our newest client platform engineer are Dropbox s new workplace, making what you do the foundation of how we facilitate a new workplace culture at Dropbox.
Your responsibilities will include enhancing the capabilities of a relatively new deployment of Jamf to meet our usability, telemetry, and security needs.
This includes defining and implementing the interfaces that different Dropboxers use in their day-to-day computing environment.
For most of the company that means creating a robust and useful Self Service portal For our internal support team, that means an interface that empowers them to solve problems and unblock Dropboxers whose work is impacted by an issue For our organization, that means creating an interface that hosts telemetry data that verifies the integrity and security of every system in our fleet And, for the CPE team, that means leveraging Jamf s more advanced capabilities to create an engineering workflow that bridges the gap between source control and deployment automation By joining Dropbox you ll have a specific role to fill, and will collaborate with a number of cross-functional teams to deliver high impact services to Dropboxers across the entire company.
Initially, there s a lot of foundational work to be done.
Over time, we expect that the problem sets will become less foundational and more advanced requiring more detailed data-driven analysis and review to inform decision-making.
We can t promise that it ll be easy, but we can promise that it ll be a lot of fun and you ll both learn a lot and teach us a lot along the way, too.
Responsibilities Perform integrations and automations that make Dropboxer's Macs easier to use for their day-to-day work Build and maintain desktop applications that enhance Dropboxer s user experience Proactively expand subject mastery by prioritizing continuing education through independent study, educational programs, and conference attendance Keep current on Apple and Jamf's latest product developments, capabilities, and bugs, as well as, familiarity with the competitive landscape of tooling for macOS management Plan and implement solutions for organizational problems within a company-wide cadence that cascades from annual plan, to quarterly Objective and Key Results, to 2 week sprints Assist with researching and reviewing project statements of work by identifing dependencies and prerequisites Proactively update management on deadlines, deliverables, and requirements to maintain accurate forecasting as new information is discovered Act as the technical lead for projects assigned by management Represent the Workplace Experience Team's macOS platform expertise within Dropbox's corporate environment Draft and edit documentation as part of project deliverables and keep it up-to-date with current state Cultivate cross-functional relationships with other organizations within Dropbox Model and promote a can-do, high energy, inclusive workplace that cultivates everyone's talents, strengths, curiosity, and creativity Requirements Certification in Jamf 200 or equivalent experience that demonstrates mastery of the knowledge domains covered by that certification Five years of experience shell scripting to automate systems administration workloads Five years experience working with web APIs to integrate communications between server services using a programming or scripting language other than the shell.
For example, Python, Ruby, or Swift Five years experience using source control, such as git, with CI/CD integrations for systems management applications One to three years experience writing and/or designing systems written in Swift, Objective-C, or another combination of languages Excellent presentation and writing skills to both technical and non-technical audiences in a remote environment A bachelor's degree in any field of study or equivalent post-secondary experience providing a depth and breadth of reading, writing, and problem solving experience.

Target Global Supply Chain and Logistics is evolving at a rapid pace. We are constantly reimagining how to get the right product to the guest better, faster and more cost effectively than before. We are operating smarter, better utilizing our resources and leveraging data driven decisions to deliver the convenience and service levels our guest demands. We are driven to win in this competitive, rapidly changing business by providing a differentiated and frictionless guest experience. Our teams work with the agility our mission requires, and we rapidly develop and deploy new approaches and processes that improve existing, and enable new capabilities. We’re looking for exceptional people who are proactive, creative, independent, innovative, practical and comfortable with ambiguity. Are you a critical thinker who seeks the root cause and can analyze both qualitatively and quantitatively? Are you a creative problem-solver who simplifies problems, quickly identifies solutions, and can build and execute effective plans to address? If so, you will have success on one of our dynamic teams.

A role on the Supply Chain Operations Intelligence Team (OI Team) means being central to our reimagining within Global Supply Chain and Logistics. This strategic team designs, builds, tests and iterates solutions that drive change to meet the unique and evolving requirements of the future business model, optimize for cost, and facilitate increased speed and flexibility. The OI team has a mix of business acumen, technical skills, and experiences that allow it to identify and solve business challenges using proven problem solving methodologies and quickly deliver solutions. The OI team provides an ideal opportunity to work within a highly collaborative, cross functional team managing multiple complex relationships, partnerships and interactions simultaneously. Your specific expertise—whether it’s people, process, technology, or data—will be felt well beyond the boundaries of the supply chain organization, positively impacting Target team members and guests alike.

As a Sr Supply Chain Data Analyst, you will continuously strive to automate and simplify workflow monitoring activities by modeling, creating test simulations and produce reports and tools from raw data. You will independently create and manage reporting metrics and determine how best to provide visibility to operation performance via report creation, insights and analyzing system dashboards. You will work with internal data teams to improve key performance metrics and provide actionable insights. This is accomplished by analyzing operational and financial data to inform performance improvement opportunities with an emphasis on understanding key operational performance indicators and the impact they have on expense, which ultimately improves the supply chain’s bottom line. As new tools and reports are deployed, this position creates and facilitates user acceptance testing and drive adoption across the operational team. You will monitor, analyze and adjust daily node operations to minimize adverse impacts to freight flow & adjust inputs and assumptions required to continuously align operational capacities to workload. This impacts the staffing and productivity of the operations to keep the facility on budget. You will plan processes and own the operational execution of performance monitoring routines throughout the shift.
