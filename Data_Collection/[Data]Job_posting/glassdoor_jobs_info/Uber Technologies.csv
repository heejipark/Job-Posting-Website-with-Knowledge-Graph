Uber Engineering is growing quickly as we look to take on some exciting opportunities at scale and around the world. As we grow our team and code base, there is a growing need for automatic analysis tools to keep our code quality and performance high while ensuring our engineers can continue to adapt quickly. To support this need, the Programming Systems Group is looking for hardworking engineers to develop new optimizations, static and dynamic analysis tools, and programming models, and apply them to Uber's code base.

The team is seeking to build tools to improve performance and reliability across a variety of languages, including Java (mobile and backend), Swift, Go, Kotlin, and TypeScript. The work includes a mix of both building or extending core infrastructure and developing new optimizations/analyses targeted at key issues. Recent work by the team includes Piranha & NullAway static analysis tools. The team has upstreamed changes to the Swift compiler to improve specialization of protocol-based code including contributions to LLVM for optimizing mobile app binary-size. In general, we like to make our tools open source and write about our work in blog posts and academic papers. We also participate actively in the research community, including attending conferences, organizing workshops, and serving on program committees.",30d+,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=112&ao=1110586&s=58&guid=0000018469b89e21bbedbf8f9a491995&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_09f7020a&cb=1668221065612&jobListingId=1007450767201&cpc=3BA4CE39D5B5DEF5&jrtk=3-0-1ghkrh7ipkcnq801-1ghkrh7jdgsro800-301ac859f713359d--6NYlbfkN0AVIi8UxprrPGU7QPohOxOOpynq0pcPnEidcD-eE3H2Sjj4_Pku15tMmP7NP-uADjpir7SmAaQJVnzZrpuMYxsF-yYOwoOO593qg1FplgW-__6CHWDDXusZKNQZ4cWF55KHZZNCwRmOdAPM9ilO1l-Al2tF8dNA4jgCg_SxfDr1e7jScGczoJLrfAzCGLHQSSG2iNJeaUg-wzFRn3t0MAajBy-HmCy6aB70slPuSd70SzJP9TooDrOhzrIZSwhOMKk7yhZkh1YB4UL_49iKSVUkMGNt4rIkf700QengYjbHxGYe3cbpp8uN-zY_khgum6c5BHZ2dX7QW4co_7CP34di6uHr4CKYwWufTYtPMqxt64HA17GctBmnssLaYyrNMq8NIlb9l9kfTJiXOsqIfU8NYs805Ih6pZkDj0Fe9tLtFeFHtey0uWiABd-o8oeXuB0Z9xBt1eEdm1_Xnu6sOwfNpm2le-RG-lUHFYP1ftSuyw8RB8ikBVfaGjMD5JR8drshrW4KV0ZLo8AR04KdKZcJv71RrrgRHG3Ax8x4czYVkOg0UEdsACf84pZ8AcwtGOZXJnPyL15M746WNBrSSME14Tg2MsXJYwvK9MaMbMyVLTSdoZTUO9TdqoNYFkOjHFczNPglDpgYDI2kVtR0DMbpFDgNSnqX5yKM9qwn0WTcR14cLrZ02FkgiNcoAw8iEM80i6GPa72qq2Gik81CHaEwwtmpsSGe3CuvObpKYWr-Zg3bQn3wktogP5Xl4_g7Lh_KcCrI59mKuxOSVVAH3tXSjjNjc1SBh2idGZYiGD4yZSRzz3qLPvO5A87WY8ok_MLBT8Bk8zBMyECHW_UFEXBppLoIcs5KzCBFzYhav-A4s0YbRc58rWT9DWrW7LuGvmmo0XXsyAIbqESqUITQjf6nC_Ux8Lv4Dgdh9nqgQi26-wAdjokr21FCy8QmkqzJHxRx1zJ3EEia9ZrsC6CCtXbmQvI9LQWZzVgIxpgOCT0quf4tsRnp8hGoMKI6vK8enf2tPqLR8I0_2A%3D%3D

NETWORK ENGINEER - ENTRY LEVEL JOB DESCRIPTION
BEFORE YOU APPLY:
Finding the right employees is a challenge. We typically only interview about 1% of the people who apply, and of those we actually hire, only 1 in 4 stay on past a month or two. Keys to success that we have observed among the employees who remain:
1) You must have an ability to choose not to engage in stress.
We operate in an environment that can be demanding. For most people, ""demanding"" translates into ""stressful"", beyond their control or choice. But for a small portion of the people, ""demanding"" becomes a ""challenge"", and any stress induced by the challenge does not become overwhelming or debilitating. That's the guy we need. If you are like most people and get stressed easily, you more than a month in our specific environment.",4d,

Have you ever ordered a car service on Uber, and when the ride arrives, wondered how it got to you so fast? Ever ordered food on UberEats and wondered where the driver was before receiving your order and how long it took to get to the restaurant or if your order was ready when the courier arrived? Ever wondered why your grocery delivery from Uber always has the best apple picked? If so, Uber Core Analytics & Science (CAS) is for you. In CAS, we strive to make magic within Uber’s marketplace. This requires judgment to make difficult trade-offs, blending algorithms with human ingenuity, and the ability to create simplicity from complexity. When we get the balance right for everyone, Uber magic happens. We build systems to peer into the future to design the most cost-efficient marketplace for matching supply and demand.
