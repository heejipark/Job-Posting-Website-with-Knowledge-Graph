BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
In 2017, the Department of Commerce (DOC) was asked to conduct an investigation into the impact on our national security from imports of steel mill products and from imports of wrought and unwrought aluminum. These investigations were carried out under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended. On January 11, 2018, the DOC formally submitted to President Trump the results of the investigation. On March 8, 2018 President Trump announced Presidential Proclamations 9704 and 9705 ordering Section 232 tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum. The Secretary of Commerce has the authority to grant exclusions from the duties, “if the steel or aluminum articles are determined not to be in a sufficient and reasonable available amount or of a satisfactory quality or based upon specific national security considerations.” Individuals or organizations using steel articles in business activities or supplying steel to users in the U.S. may submit exclusion requests with respect to the Proclamation. In addition, any individual or organization in the U.S. can file objections to exclusions. The DOC’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has the lead on national security analysis. The Enforcement and Compliance (E&C) unit of the DOC’s International Trade Administration is responsible for providing technical analyses for product exclusions related to the proceedings and submitting a recommendation to BIS on whether the technical merits of the request and objections warrant approving or denying the exclusion request. Currently, E&C does not have sufficient staff resources with the expertise required to evaluate the exclusion requests and objections to requests.

Talent Acquisition Recruiter – Blue Buffalo Pet Food R&D / Supply Chain
Love them like family, feed them like family.” ® Everything at Blue Buffalo starts with this simple idea.
Blue Buffalo (BLUE), is one of the strongest and most recognized pet food brands in America, and the undisputed leader in Wholesome Natural pet food, the fastest growing segment of the market. At over four times the size of the next largest brand in this segment, BLUE has become the new mainstream brand that’s delivering products that pet parents are looking for, and connecting with them in a true, authentic way.
BLUE thinks of dogs and cats as family members and believes their food should be natural and healthy. In fact, this was the motivation for the Bishop Family’s decision to create the Blue Buffalo Company. When the beloved Bishop family dog, Blue, faced a variety of health issues, Bill and his two sons, Billy and Chris, set out to create a pet food that was made with only the highest quality natural ingredients—the kind of things a family member deserves. Fifteen years later BLUE has, in many ways, accomplished what the Bishops set out to do—help our dogs and cats live happy, healthy lives.

Using an engineering approach, the Electrical Engineer in this unique position will test, maintain, refine, design, build, troubleshoot, and ready advanced equipment and associated components for field data acquisition. This position will have the freedom to conceive, design, and build hardware and software supporting data acquisition for a wide range of geologic and hydrologic applications. The Electrical Engineer provides a leadership role in training on the proper use and handling of equipment. This person will troubleshoot electronic equipment, often in a field environment, and repair or implement replacement options. This position is provided opportunities to advise and brainstorm with internationally recognized experts during the conception and development of advanced sensing and recording systems.

The ideal candidate will be more gratified in solving a problem with a circuit and custom algorithm than deriving a differential equation. They’ll be a person who can map a path from the need to the goal, even if it means using ‘black-tape and baling wire’ to get there.

Keeping current with technology and networking is vital for personal and professional growth. This engineering position will be provided opportunities to travel to professional society conventions/meetings and engage in a range of professional service functions. Travel across the US to some of the most unique and out of the way places in support of field research has been an option for this position for decades now and it will continue to be well into the future. Working with US Government scientists routinely involves cutting edge work on sensitive data from locations rarely seen by the general public. This is not your run-of-the-mill electrical engineering position. Every day provides challenges and satisfaction with incredible freedom to explore and conceive using skills developed in the classroom.

SALARY, EMPLOYMENT STATUS, AND FRINGE BENEFITS: Full-time position with benefits, subject to a six-month probation and annual performance reviews. Salary is $75,000 or higher, commensurate with qualifications and experience.

KU offers great benefits to employees with up to 22 days of paid vacation earned per year, 12 days of sick leave earned per year, 9 paid holidays plus one discretionary day, a retirement program, medical & dental insurance, life and disability insurance, other benefit plan options, and State of Kansas discounts offered by various vendors.

The services provide drilling in support of water, energy, and basic subsurface research. It also runs a program designed to monitor changes and identify regional trends in the High Plains, Dakota, and alluvial aquifers, measuring about 1,380 wells in 47 central and western Kansas counties.
