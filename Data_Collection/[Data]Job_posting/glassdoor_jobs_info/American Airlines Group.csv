American Airlines is looking for Software Developers of all levels. As a Software Developer at American Airlines, we expect you to be empathetic towards customers.

Successful Software Developers at American Airlines excel in three key areas:
Software Delivery
Product Mindset
Growth Mindset
Software Development Teams at American Airlines find ways to improve daily work. This means taking an honest look at delivery metrics and asking what we will do to improve them. We expect a team to ask ""why has our deployment frequency declined over the last month?"" and work towards a solution to improve the situation as a team, under their own direction. In short, we want everyone to invest in continually improving themselves and their ways of working, while achieving product success.
You will engage in all aspects of the Product lifecycle and work to grow your skills in Lean Product Development. We expect our engineers to dig in and solve business problems as true partners. We love small solutions and collecting data to draw conclusions.
To build new solutions and chase new hypotheses, our teams are constantly learning. We accept failures as learning experiences and use those experiences to build resiliency in our systems.
Depending on level, the role is a balance of technical coaching and hands-on development work. All Software Developers write code daily, regardless of level. What you'll do

Work with the delivery manager to identify training and growth opportunities. Recommend personal growth paths in conjunction with Delivery Manager.
Help articulate and eliminate team blockers with the Delivery Manager (as needed).
Participate in architecture and software design with the Squad - in general, encourages the team to work on new ideas and emergent, iterative design. Focuses on constructively arguing against solutions that are not a fit, if necessary.

American Airlines is looking for Software Developers of all levels. As a Software Developer at American Airlines, we expect you to be empathetic towards customers. American Airlines believes that our purpose is to care for our people on life's journey, customer or team member. We want teams to let that care guide how we work and what we build.

Successful Software Developers at American Airlines excel in three key areas:
Software Delivery
Product Mindset
Growth Mindset
Software Development Teams at American Airlines find ways to improve daily work. This means taking an honest look at delivery metrics and asking what we will do to improve them. We expect a team to ask ""why has our deployment frequency declined over the last month?"" and work towards a solution to improve the situation as a team, under their own direction. In short, we want everyone to invest in continually improving themselves and their ways of working, while achieving product success.
You will engage in all aspects of the Product lifecycle and work to grow your skills in Lean Product Development. We expect our engineers to dig in and solve business problems as true partners. We love small solutions and collecting data to draw conclusions.
To build new solutions and chase new hypotheses, our teams are constantly learning. We accept failures as learning experiences and use those experiences to build resiliency in our systems.
Depending on level, the role is a balance of technical coaching and hands-on development work. All Software Developers write code daily, regardless of level. What you'll do

Work with the delivery manager to identify training and growth opportunities. Recommend personal growth paths in conjunction with Delivery Manager.
Help articulate and eliminate team blockers with the Delivery Manager (as needed).
Participate in architecture and software design with the Squad - in general, encourages the team to work on new ideas and emergent, iterative design. Focuses on constructively arguing against solutions that are not a fit, if necessary.

Software Development Teams at American Airlines find ways to improve daily work. This means taking an honest look at delivery metrics and asking what we will do to improve them.

You will engage in all aspects of the Product lifecycle and work to grow your skills in Lean Product Development. We expect our engineers to dig in and solve business problems as true partners. We love small solutions and collecting data to draw conclusions.
To build new solutions and chase new hypotheses, our teams are constantly learning. We accept failures as learning experiences and use those experiences to build resiliency in our systems.

Work with the delivery manager to identify training and growth opportunities. Recommend personal growth paths in conjunction with Delivery Manager.
Help articulate and eliminate team blockers with the Delivery Manager (as needed).
Participate in architecture and software design with the Squad - in general, encourages the team to work on new ideas and emergent, iterative design. Focuses on constructively arguing against solutions that are not a fit, if necessary.
Partners with the Product Owner (presenting Playback, keeping focus on business value, etc.) as needed to support the overall Squad's delivery.
A strong willingness to learn and the ability to show vulnerability when you do not know something All you'll need for success

In the case of a disaster or emergency work may require periodic, 24-hour on-call duty and travel to remote locations in small aircraft and boats, and may involve exposure to inherently hazardous or potentially dangerous environmental conditions.


To be successful in the position a candidate will need the following core competencies:


1. Must be willing and able to travel within the state, including very remote areas or out of state on an as needed basis. Transportation can be via commercial airlines (big and small), very small planes, helicopters, boats, snow machines, all-terrain vehicles to remote areas of the state in support of the division’s mission.

2.

Help articulate and eliminate team blockers with the Delivery Manager (as needed).
Participate in architecture and software design with the Squad - in general, encourages the team to work on new ideas and emergent, iterative design. Focuses on constructively arguing against solutions that are not a fit, if necessary.

American Airlines is looking for Software Developers of all levels. As a Software Developer at American Airlines, we expect you to be empathetic towards customers. American Airlines believes that our purpose is to care for our people on life's journey, customer or team member. We want teams to let that care guide how we work and what we build. As a developer on a product team at American Airlines you will create awesome experiences.

Of course, we also want to make sure we are having fun, working with, and caring for - amazing people. Why you'll love this job
Successful Software Developers at American Airlines excel in three key areas:
Software Delivery
Product Mindset
Growth Mindset
Software Development Teams at American Airlines find ways to improve daily work. This means taking an honest look at delivery metrics and asking what we will do to improve them. We expect a team to ask ""why has our deployment frequency declined over the last month?"" and work towards a solution to improve the situation as a team, under their own direction. In short, we want everyone to invest in continually improving themselves and their ways of working, while achieving product success.
You will engage in all aspects of the Product lifecycle and work to grow your skills in Lean Product Development. We expect our engineers to dig in and solve business problems as true partners. We love small solutions and collecting data to draw conclusions.
To build new solutions and chase new hypotheses, our teams are constantly learning. We accept failures as learning experiences and use those experiences to build resiliency in our systems.
Depending on level, the role is a balance of technical coaching and hands-on development work. All Software Developers write code daily, regardless of level. What you'll do

Work with the delivery manager to identify training and growth opportunities. Recommend personal growth paths in conjunction with Delivery Manager.
Help articulate and eliminate team blockers with the Delivery Manager (as needed).
Participate in architecture and software design with the Squad - in general, encourages the team to work on new ideas and emergent, iterative design. Focuses on constructively arguing against solutions that are not a fit, if necessary.
Partners with the Product Owner (presenting Playback, keeping focus on business value, etc.) as needed to support the overall Squad's delivery.
