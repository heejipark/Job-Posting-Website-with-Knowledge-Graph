The Finance Technology group at American Express is entering into a new phase of technology transformation driven by opportunities to simplify processes, deepen business intelligence, analytics and reporting, and raise operational efficiency. If you have the talent and desire to deliver innovative products and services at a rapid pace, with hands on experience and strategic thinking, in areas of data management and analytics, cloud computing, and modern software engineering, join our leadership team to be part of our transformation journey

I’m the principal engineer looking after finance technologies, and I’m looking for two passionate engineers to join my team. I have a wide range of scope, and so the roles I have open are slightly different.

One Staff Engineer will be looking after our development enablement. At the moment we have a mix of technologies, and a diverse range of technical maturity. Some of our apps have nice CICD pipelines, and are cloud naitive, others are large COTS software platforms which sit on VMs. There’s a lot of scope out here for a superstar engineer. I’m looking for someone who’s passionate about pushing platforms towards a cloud-native pattern, building pipelines, working with PaaS to understand gaps and getting us ready for a move towards hybrid cloud. This role will include leading a small group of engineers (1-2 scrum teams; it will not grow beyond this) who will increase your reach to help get stuff done, but the focus of the role is more on engineering than delivery.

For this role I’m looking for someone who is bold in their approach to fixing problems, and isn’t afraid of disrupting the status quo. You should be comfortable with people leading, optimal ways to use Jenkins, Github, K8S, Paas and other enablement tooling you may wish to introduce. Contributions to CNCF projects, speaking at devcon and an active profile on slack would all be great ways of demonstrating your readiness for this role.

Our other Staff Engineer role is a little different. Finance tech runs on extremely large data sets, and a lot of our applications focus on moving and processing vast data sets. We are looking to build a holistic approach to consuming and processing data, with a “data marketplace” to improve discoverability and traceability of data elements. Some of this tech is new to me, so I’m looking for someone with a strong background in data technologies, including traditional RDBMS, object stores, modern in-memory data transformations, traditional ETL tools as well as having a view on GCP and how things may look there – we’re aiming to be bleeding edge at amex around getting on that platform.

So to be a great fit for this role you’d typically have spent a good amount of time working with databases, understand the compromises and design patterns that are optimal. The perfect candidate would also be very comfortable with building distributed apps and frameworks to help accelerate engineers in our org. Some experience with architecting cloud-ready solutions as well as expertise in how to bring modern engineering practices (automated testing, zero-touch deployments) to some classic data tools would also be great.

I like to stick away from hard requirements in roles, preferring to hire those who can demonstrate passion and expertise, however these roles are director-level role, so I’ll be looking for candidates who can perform as well as someone with a decade of experience.

If you’re excited by what we’re doing, but don’t think either of these roles is for you, please drop me a line and we can have a chat; I’ll be growing my team further in the coming months so there may be more opportunities that suit better over time.
