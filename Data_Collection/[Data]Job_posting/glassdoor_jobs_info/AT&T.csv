Job Description:

The American Red Cross is seeking an Associate Service Designer, Humanitarian Services Digital Product Management. This position is a Work from Home position and can be located anywhere in the continental US.







The Humanitarian Services Product Management team aspires to create human-centered digital experiences for our workforce and clients and to ensure our digital products support successful mission delivery. As a Service Designer, you will apply design thinking approaches and collaborate with cross-functional teams to facilitate discovery of problems and opportunities in both digital experiences and business processes as well as co-create solutions to improve the experience, adoption, and mission success of our digital product portfolio. Our products support our humanitarian mission in many ways, including delivering financial assistance to those impacted by disasters, visualizing situational awareness for disaster response and logistics operations, and onboarding and assigning volunteers to critical mission roles.

Typical activities include using design thinking methods (e.g., ideation, journey mapping, service blueprinting, prototyping, testing, and feedback) as well as business analysis methods (e.g., business capability and process mapping) throughout the product design and delivery lifecycle and with a wide range of audiences, from senior leadership to front-line implementers. You'll work closely with product engineering colleagues on user story development and solution design. You'll bring a holistic view by researching externally for design inspiration and best practices while incorporating internal constraints such as business and technology policy, compliance, and standards to reduce risk.

The digital product that this individual will be servicing is our Volunteer Connection workforce management system. This system is used to recruit, match, onboard, train, deploy and continuously engage and recognize our volunteer workforce across all Red Cross business units and lines of service. We take a holistic view of the entire digital experience for prospective and current volunteers and ask how might we make it easier to volunteer with us, find new opportunities to contribute, and deliver mission-critical services.



1. Collaborating with technology, product, and business teams to uncover customer and business needs and translate them into intuitive and engaging digital experience designs that lead to desired mission outcomes.

2. Facilitating discovery sprints and workshops to support early-stage product definition by uncovering customer pain points and opportunities.

We use data, tech, and automation to simplify insurance from start to finish — cutting out the long, bait-and-switch quotes and unnecessary costs in the traditional insurance process.

But we’re not just changing the way home and auto insurance works. We want to change what it means to “work in insurance,” too. Restoring insurance to its original purpose — a force for communal good. Together, we’re getting back to getting each other’s back. The way insurance was always supposed to be.
