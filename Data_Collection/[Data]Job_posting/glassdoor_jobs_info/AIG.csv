In 2016, AIG created a “Legacy” portfolio as a separate non-core segment representing insurance reserves associated with discontinued lines of commercial Property & Casualty and Life & Annuity insurance businesses. The following year, AIG formed a Bermuda-domiciled composite reinsurer, now Fortitude Re, to house the Legacy portfolio in a separate, distinct, well-capitalized balance sheet with a dedicated management team. In 2018, the company entered into a series of L&A and P&C reinsurance transactions with AIG and received an initial capitalization of ~$3 BN. The transactions represented ~$37 BN of reserves supported by ~$40 BN of invested assets. During this time, AIG also entered into a long-term partnership with The Carlyle Group, with Carlyle acquiring 19.9 % ownership. Then in 2019, The Carlyle Group and T&D announced acquisition of majority interest in Fortitude Re from AIG. This allowed for a new long-term shareholder base for the company while maintaining a strong capital position for supporting reinsurance obligations.

In 2016, AIG created a “Legacy” portfolio as a separate non-core segment representing insurance reserves associated with discontinued lines of commercial Property & Casualty and Life & Annuity insurance businesses. The following year, AIG formed a Bermuda-domiciled composite reinsurer, now Fortitude Re, to house the Legacy portfolio in a separate, distinct, well-capitalized balance sheet with a dedicated management team. In 2018, the company entered into a series of L&A and P&C reinsurance transactions with AIG and received an initial capitalization of ~$3 BN. The transactions represented ~$37 BN of reserves supported by ~$40 BN of invested assets. During this time, AIG also entered into a long-term partnership with The Carlyle Group, with Carlyle acquiring 19.9 % ownership. Then in 2019, The Carlyle Group and T&D announced acquisition of majority interest in Fortitude Re from AIG. This allowed for a new long-term shareholder base for the company while maintaining a strong capital position for supporting reinsurance obligations.

Receives direct (Assistant Planner) and general (Associate Planner) supervision from supervisory or management personnel. Exercises no direct supervision over staff.


Assistant Planner: This is the first working level class in the professional Planner series. Initially under close supervision, incumbents with basic planning experience perform professional and technical planning work in current, advance, and/or environmental planning activities. As experience is gained, assignments become more varied and are performed with greater independence. Positions at this level usually perform most of the duties required of the positions at the Associate Planner level but are not expected to function at the same skill level and usually exercise less independent discretion and judgment in matters related to work procedures and methods. Work is usually supervised while in progress and fits an established structure or pattern. Exceptions or changes in procedures are explained in detail as they arise.

Positions in the Planner class series are flexibly staffed and positions at the Associate level are normally filled by advancement from the Assistant level after gaining the knowledge, skill, and experience which meet the qualifications for and after demonstrating the ability to perform the work of the higher-level class.",16d,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=111&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=000001846ca3a928895ac6d9e3f7d7ef&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_64a6edc1&cb=1668270012813&jobListingId=1008236703772&jrtk=3-0-1ghma7aan2ap5001-1ghma7ab8j4hn800-55b74daa941ed029-

In 2016, AIG created a “Legacy” portfolio as a separate non-core segment representing insurance reserves associated with discontinued lines of commercial Property & Casualty and Life & Annuity insurance businesses. The following year, AIG formed a Bermuda-domiciled composite reinsurer, now Fortitude Re, to house the Legacy portfolio in a separate, distinct, well-capitalized balance sheet with a dedicated management team. In 2018, the company entered into a series of L&A and P&C reinsurance transactions with AIG and received an initial capitalization of ~$3 BN. The transactions represented ~$37 BN of reserves supported by ~$40 BN of invested assets. During this time, AIG also entered into a long-term partnership with The Carlyle Group, with Carlyle acquiring 19.9 % ownership. Then in 2019, The Carlyle Group and T&D announced acquisition of majority interest in Fortitude Re from AIG. This allowed for a new long-term shareholder base for the company while maintaining a strong capital position for supporting reinsurance obligations.
