Did you know there is over $1 trillion of waste every year in healthcare? One of the biggest contributors to the staggering amount of waste is inefficient operations. If you’ve ever spent hours waiting in the ER; if a hospitalized family member experienced a delayed discharge; if you’ve had to schedule a surgical procedure far into the future due to lack of available Operating Room time — then you understand the kinds of problems we solve.

Our mission is to simplify how healthcare operates. We partner with health systems to automate care operations — all of the operational activities involved in delivering care, from discharge planning, to OR access, to patient flow, and more. Our software combines AI, machine learning, and behavioral science to power best-practice solutions for settings across the hospital and system.

Key job responsibilities

About the team
For more than 14 years, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud computing platform. What is cloud computing? Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, companies can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from AWS. AWS offers over 175 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality, media, and application development, deployment, and management from 77 Availability Zones across 24 geographic regions. AWS services are trusted by millions of active customers around the world - including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—to power their infrastructure, make them more agile, and lower costs. AWS is committed to running our business in the most environmentally friendly way possible, and our scale allows us to achieve higher resource utilization and energy efficiency than the typical on-premises data center. In 2019 Amazon announced The Climate Pledge, which includes our commitment to power our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, on the path to achieving net zero carbon across our businesses by 2040.
