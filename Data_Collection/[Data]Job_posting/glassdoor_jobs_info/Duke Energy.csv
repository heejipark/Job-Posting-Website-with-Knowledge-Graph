Project Overview:
Bechtel is the licensing, engineering, procurement, and construction partner on TerraPower’s Natrium team. Selected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, Natrium is participating in a DOE initiative to re-establish U.S. leadership in nuclear energy that provides matching funding to industry to design and build an operational advanced reactor. TerraPower, a leading advanced generation technology company founded by former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, will be deploying its 345 MWe sodium fast reactor (SFR), called Natrium. The Natrium plant features an advanced, cost-competitive reactor design that is safer, simpler, easier and less costly to construct, less expensive to operate, and able to provide energy that is competitive with fossil fuels. It also features an innovative molten salt energy storage system designed to be complementary to solar and wind power by evening out the peaks and valleys in production when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing. With the reactor and energy storage output combined, the plant can produce more than 500 MWe of power.",15d,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=101&ao=1110586&s=58&guid=000001846ac5dd4393a50b2f8f16960b&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_6210b799&cb=1668238671238&jobListingId=1008238326279&cpc=3BA4CE39D5B5DEF5&jrtk=3-0-1ghlcbnbjma71801-1ghlcbnc3i17g800-03d246f44bf17b25--6NYlbfkN0D1HrGvM3IO11DU-hdc4u4iftvEi0SlREeNwZASq2ihTw1OyUwQHweFYxnUKMnFMotaU1fJtwVQoCDfuSeLSU0NNyoYrcdYx1MLSTEDfjzfm75BstVZRlp9wUc8a1TdS-Xoc8bCpPiUnVCaOnDbDj7FZkUEqhwLVR67o0QSwVUdX_x0ZQrCECmRsOvqLrnoCxzNvT_YR7QMymKFWOpU19JZb4mEWkulEMyMw-4tasl5j2PgeOmPa_pfnOedKwyYuNL8eHLOeFBddBllr3FCAeSKRWCmjcP1BEozh_vqs29GoJ50t9SUDsn-L5Ys6RIgzdT1qUXUw-ID1l5Zw3FtcpYQEmRigfbMlCo9pSOsOHSgNsc5RYq_unXTHBaT7fKlgOWOmi4wy7SU9vJHR-LsoeIz6jJ8P5_lVplfcZlHOgyPsWkRULhkVQOeQFs_qRD2J3DePRdpD1MKXeNjzA_d95OAGBN8qmgbksAx8dcFJG82LLEMCweCZY1-p_lxjI2myCc7ZlTwUuXQW8qAjJv6aKvvm56tYHCQLFsCpvxNMJUMyxImUvwQ_XR0Nz7WWC-zR8Hkx1_oLHCeZ0Jkw_sDZJkVxJTSQae0Qr8j8yvqgKvdeycQYvsudHsHwlTc-wgrcb0%3D
