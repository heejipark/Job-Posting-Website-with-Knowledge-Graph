Description

Control Management is designed to ensure a strong and consistent control environment across the organization from front office to back office, irrespective of line of business or functional area. With control managers appointed for each line of business, function and region, there is a comprehensive coverage/accountability model that promotes firmwide dialogue and consistency in approach and solutions.

The Control Management Controls Room team works collaboratively with other control disciplines and oversees existing control functions as well as the development of new control functions and protocols. The team's objective is to empower the three lines of defense with risk-based information to manage their control environment. One way we achieve this is by managing and developing applications to monitor and report on the control effectiveness to help mitigate operational risk for the Firm.

The team is seeking an experienced analytics candidate to develop dashboards and innovative analytical solutions for the control management organization. In this role, you will work at the intersection of analytics, user experience, and product development by brainstorming and developing reports through detailed analysis of operational risk data. You will work with business subject matter experts and LOB Control Managers, as well as partner with our Technology software engineers to perform analysis and develop solutions to turn complex, technical concepts into reporting outputs that drive insights for both analytical and non-analytical audiences. You will be responsible for designing and developing ETL workflows and datasets in Alteryx and building new custom Tableau dashboards to meet business requirements.

The ideal candidate will combine deep data insight and a strong analytics skill set with a product development lifecycle experience and understanding. Hands on experience conducting complex analysis on large data sets, involvement in story writing and product development, and a keen eye toward program, project, and analysis completion to meet deadlines are vital for success in this role.",23d,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=130&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=000001846a7aac13a5dc4247453ab504&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_0bcfa488&cb=1668233820497&jobListingId=1008217505840&jrtk=3-0-1ghl7lb23kuh2801-1ghl7lb2ki7nt800-d800792f9b1931ea-
