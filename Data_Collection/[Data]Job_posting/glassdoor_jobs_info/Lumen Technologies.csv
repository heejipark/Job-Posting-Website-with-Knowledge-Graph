Guillermo (Gary) J. Tearney, M.D., Ph.D.
Tearney Lab – Wellman Center for Photomedicine
Massachusetts General Hospital

The Tearney Lab is an 80+ person multidisciplinary lab led by Guillermo (Gary) Tearney, MD, PhD. The goal of the Tearney Lab is to see every cell in the human body so that disease can be detected at its earliest stages when it can be cured.

To this end, the lab has pioneered multiple optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices that enable 3D imaging at the microscopic scale in living human patients. These technologies include multimodality OCT where OCT is combined with spectroscopy, fluorescence, and other optical techniques, ultrahigh-resolution OCT (µOCT) where the resolution is sufficiently detailed to visualize individual cells, and functional OCT that measures the function and metabolism of cells in living systems. These technologies are implemented in a variety of devices (endoscopes, catheters, capsules, implantable) that provide accessible imaging anywhere inside the body. The lab has major programs to overcome clinical diagnostic challenges in celiac disease, food allergy disorders, malnutrition, coronary artery disease, hearing loss, GI cancer, and cystic fibrosis, among others. Novel technologies are created using device development processes and tested and validated in over 15 ongoing single- and multi-center clinical studies.

To enable this broad translational research, the Tearney Lab is outfitted with:
