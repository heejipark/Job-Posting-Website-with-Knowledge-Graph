"['Insight Global', '3.9']",http://www.insightglobal.com/,Senior Information Security Analyst (CTFC),"Chandler, AZ",$53K - $75K (Glassdoor est.),"JOB DESCRIPTION
Summary:
The Vulnerability Operations team is a governance team aligned to the Technology Infrastructure and Information Security organizations at Wells Fargo. The team provides oversight of outstanding enterprise-wide software vulnerabilities and facilitates their rapid research and subsequent closure. The team also owns and executes enterprise risk management controls and maintains documentation and evidence sufficient to provide adequate defense in annual internal audits and possible regulatory scrutiny.

This particular role is responsible for helping to ensure actions from our team remain on track by building a Jira-based service desk and overseeing intake, prioritization, and delivery of solutions for known issues, required deliverables, and other actions which will be submitted into the service desk and need oversight to ensure successful, on-time completion. This role will have a particular focus on helping to respond or drive response to audit and risk management deliverables such as RCSA and control reviews.

The role requires strong spreadsheet analysis skills, strong Jira skills, strong communication and facilitation skills, a cool head under pressure, and a collaborative, encouraging spirit with a sense of humor.

Description:
Seeking a proactive, independent team member with superb attention to detail to help a risk governance team to deliver on its mission. The successful candidate will be a go-getter who takes charge and leads assigned work boldly without concern for who needs to be engaged to get results.

Develop an understanding of incoming work, identify the affected parties, communicate action needed concisely, and work with the teams to track the deliverables until done, escalating when deliverables are missed, and working with teams in whatever granularity needed to bring the work back on track with an appropriate sense of urgency. Analyze demand and capacity constraints of the team to identify efforts / or work items in jeopardy and craft communications and reports which provide transparency into progress and insight into problems or actions needed by leaders. Success is based on proactive escalation and visibility into items at risk or experiencing active issues and your efforts to resolve challenges.
Lead meetings to review outstanding items and capture status or impediments to forward action. Engage necessary parties to resolve impediments and to keep work moving, or escalate to manager for support.

This team is not Agile, and a move to Agile is not in scope for this role. The successful candidate: (1) will manage pressure well. This is not a constantly high pressure job, but there are deadlines, and we must remain on track. (2) will take ownership of assigned work and execute in line with documented procedure, (3) will communicate extremely clearly in writing and on the phone; virtually 100% of the job is via phone or email with people in other locations. Communication is critical. (4) will maintain a professional and friendly demeanor at all times, (5) will see this role as an opportunity to demonstrate servant leadership in action, (6) will be self-motivated and will look for ways to add value beyond the letter of the assignment, (7) will find a way to clarify and simplify complicated scenarios for leadership decision and quick understanding.

Key points:
