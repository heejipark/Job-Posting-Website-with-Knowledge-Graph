IntelliTec Colleges, founded in 1965, started with a simple goal to provide skilled workers to the Colorado Springs community.

Our mission is to provide vocational education preparing our students for in-demand careers and that means preparing our students as best we can to be successful employees when they walk out the door. For our employees, the best days of the year are at each graduation ceremony when we get to see the look of accomplishment on the faces of our graduates as they walk across the stage, knowing they’re on to bigger and better things.
