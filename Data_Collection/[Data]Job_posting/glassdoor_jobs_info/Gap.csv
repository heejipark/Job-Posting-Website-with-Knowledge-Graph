JOB SUMMARY
Per Scaled Agile principles, enabling continuous flow through the end-to-end value stream in today’s enterprises can be complex. Practitioners across multiple teams and functions must collaborate effectively. Quality and security must be built in at every step. Solutions must be architected for rapid change. Governance and compliance controls must be streamlined and automated. A slew of metrics must be managed from all layers of the solutions stack. And the right automation must be in place to enable lightning-fast flow and on-demand processing.
Managing all this complexity, let alone optimizing it for continuous flow, requires specialized knowledge by everyone in the value stream who influences product delivery. To succeed with DevOps, this knowledge must be applied at the right times by the right people and with the right tools at all stages of the process.

DevOps implies close collaboration across team and department boundaries. Skills across domains are combined to produce specific outcomes in the CDP. For example, to ensure features are developed in a way that fosters continuous delivery, knowledge from five domains (Continuous Deployment, Continuous Integration, Continuous Security, Continuous Quality, and Continuous Observability) must be applied. This ensures that solutions are developed with speed, quality, security, version control, adaptability, and maintainability in mind.

As a potential candidate for this Principle DevOps Engineer I, we would expect someone who is willing to dream big, perform with excellence and create incredible products with the below skills and abilities:




Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience


Software engineering experience (JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python): 7+
Cloud-based DevOps engineering experience: 5-8
