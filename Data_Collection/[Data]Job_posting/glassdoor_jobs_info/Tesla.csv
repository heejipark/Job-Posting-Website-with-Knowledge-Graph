Tesla Autopilot applies deep learning for autonomous driving at scale. Past features we've launched include Navigate on Autopilot (making lane changes and taking highway exits), Smart Summon (calling the Tesla to you in a parking lot without anyone in the vehicle), Stopping for Stop Signs and Traffic Lights, Radar Removal, and more than a dozen active safety features. Currently, we are working to release the Full-Self-Driving feature on city streets to the wider customer fleet. The team actively collects massive datasets from Tesla Vehicles, creates ground truth of labeled images and videos, and deploys deep neural networks to our fleet of millions of Tesla cars. As Data Project Manager, you will run the ""data engine,"" the process by which we improve neural networks via data annotation and leveraging Tesla's fleet. You will take ownership of the datasets of specific vision models (ex. stop signs) and make them large, high quality, and diverse. You will identify areas where neural networks are challenged (ex. even blue stop signs!), work with engineers to understand the requirements of neural networks, and set deliverables for the data annotation team. You will manage the variety of datasets (what should get annotated), the ontology (how data should be labeled), and close the loop on the project's impact on reducing Autopilot interventions and improving in-car performance (why data is labeled). The data engine is the most crucial aspect of ""pre-neural-network"" development and has unlocked every major Autopilot customer release.

About Tesla and Tesla Energy’s Mission

In 2016 Elon released: The Master Plan, Part Deux. In this plan he highlighted the need to Integrate Energy Generation and Storage by creating stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage. Tesla Energy’s Installation team is in the operations arm of the business. The team installs high-quality energy products (Solar Roof, Retrofit Solar, Powerwall) across the United States. To achieve this, we use a combination of direct labor and sub-contractors and partner with certified installers and new home builders.

About Tesla Energy Quality

The Quality Department's core purposes are to ensure that the services we provide and the products we install meet the design intent so that people will love them and to reduce organizational spend by identifying and reducing inefficiencies caused by operations errors and product defects. We react to issues by containing, identifying root cause, and determining corrective actions to prevent recurrence while proactively identifying and mitigating risks to improve capability and capacity of operations through new methods, tools, or material.
