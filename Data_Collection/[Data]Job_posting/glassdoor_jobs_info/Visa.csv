We value work-life balance, thoroughness, bias to action, and integrity. And we're growing quickly!

We are a remote company with no physical office, so you're able to work from any state in the United States! (We cannot accommodate work outside of the US as of right now).

You will work collaboratively with other engineers at top tier clients (including FAANG companies) innovating interesting solutions. Many of our projects are large scale cloud enterprise integrations that involve writing and altering existing software and programmatic creation of cloud-based resources. You’ll lead or support engagements where you and other engineers may do things like build out infrastructure as code, set up a CI/CD pipeline, develop an observability framework, write a management interface, validate security of cloud assets, connect cloud assets to on premises and remote users, tune automated HPC infrastructure, and similar cloud and DevOps work, all in a programmatic manner!
Our staff engineers are given broad, tough problems and operate autonomously to solve them. They perform high end technical architecture, lead major client engagements, rescue other engineers when they hit the really hard problems, help ensure our high standard of engineering quality, and mentor other engineers.
Our expectation of both of this role, is that they are skilled, independent technical leaders and executors.

Currently enrolled in a co-op program in US or Canada.
Job summary
Applicants must be currently enrolled in a co-op program at their school in US/Canada, and should have a minimum of one quarter/semester/trimester remaining in their studies after their co-op concludes.

Amazon co-ops are full-time positions, and co-op students should expect to work Monday-Friday, up to 40 hours per week typically between 8am-5pm for up to 8 months. Specific team norms around working hours will be communicated by your manager. Co-op students should not have conflicts such as classes or other employment during the Amazon work-day.

We will take your co-op season and location preferences into consideration based on business availability. Please note that a majority of our co-ops take place in the summer.

2. Fall (Starts August/September)

Software Development Engineer (SDE) Co-op
At Amazon, we hire the best minds in technology to innovate and build on behalf of our customers. The intense focus we have on our customers is why we are one of the world’s most beloved brands – customer obsession is part of our company DNA. Our co-op students write real software and collaborate with a select group of experienced software development engineers (SDEs) who guide co-op students on projects that matter to our customers.

As a co-op participant you will be matched to a manager and a mentor. You will have the opportunity to influence the evolution of Amazon technology and lead mission critical projects early in your career. Your design, code, and raw smarts will contribute to solving some of the most complex technical challenges in the areas of distributed systems, data mining, automation, optimization, scalability, and security – just to name a few.

In addition to working on an impactful project, you will have the opportunity to engage with Amazonians for both personal and professional development, expand your network, and participate in activities with other co-op students throughout your co-op experience. No matter the location of your co-op, we give you the tools to own your project and learn in a real-world setting. Many of our technologies overlap, and you would be hard pressed to find a team that is not using Amazon Web Services (AWS), touching the catalogue, or iterating services to better personalize for customers. We make the impossible, possible.
