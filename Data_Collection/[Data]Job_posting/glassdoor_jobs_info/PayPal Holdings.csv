['Six Nines IT'],,Front End Developer,"Dania, FL",$60K - $80K (Employer est.),"Who is Six Nines?
We are a software engineering first, remote native, mutually supportive consulting organization with a culture of
Continuous learning
Solution quality
Teamwork and transparency
We value work-life balance, thoroughness, bias to action, and integrity. And we're growing quickly!
Location?
We are a remote company with no physical office, so you're able to work from any state in the United States! (We cannot accommodate work outside of the US as of right now).

You will work collaboratively with other engineers at top tier clients (including FAANG companies) innovating interesting solutions. Many of our projects are large scale cloud enterprise integrations that involve writing and altering existing software and programmatic creation of cloud-based resources. You’ll lead or support engagements where you and other engineers may do things like build out infrastructure as code, set up a CI/CD pipeline, develop an observability framework, write a management interface, validate security of cloud assets, connect cloud assets to on premises and remote users, tune automated HPC infrastructure, and similar cloud and DevOps work, all in a programmatic manner!
Our staff engineers are given broad, tough problems and operate autonomously to solve them. They perform high end technical architecture, lead major client engagements, rescue other engineers when they hit the really hard problems, help ensure our high standard of engineering quality, and mentor other engineers.
Our expectation of both of this role, is that they are skilled, independent technical leaders and executors.
You’ll have the opportunity to drive new lines of business and build out entirely new toolsets to accelerate service implementations of those new use cases.
We have a separate management track; this role is for people who want to leverage their years of experience and keep working with technology.

Candidates with a strong software engineering background with DevOps and cloud experience.",11d,

But we’re not just changing the way home and auto insurance works. We want to change what it means to “work in insurance,” too. Restoring insurance to its original purpose — a force for communal good. Together, we’re getting back to getting each other’s back. The way insurance was always supposed to be.

Initially, there s a lot of foundational work to be done.
Over time, we expect that the problem sets will become less foundational and more advanced requiring more detailed data-driven analysis and review to inform decision-making.

That means our MacBooks the systems that you administer as our newest client platform engineer are Dropbox s new workplace, making what you do the foundation of how we facilitate a new workplace culture at Dropbox.
Your responsibilities will include enhancing the capabilities of a relatively new deployment of Jamf to meet our usability, telemetry, and security needs.
This includes defining and implementing the interfaces that different Dropboxers use in their day-to-day computing environment.
For most of the company that means creating a robust and useful Self Service portal For our internal support team, that means an interface that empowers them to solve problems and unblock Dropboxers whose work is impacted by an issue For our organization, that means creating an interface that hosts telemetry data that verifies the integrity and security of every system in our fleet And, for the CPE team, that means leveraging Jamf s more advanced capabilities to create an engineering workflow that bridges the gap between source control and deployment automation By joining Dropbox you ll have a specific role to fill, and will collaborate with a number of cross-functional teams to deliver high impact services to Dropboxers across the entire company.
Initially, there s a lot of foundational work to be done.
Over time, we expect that the problem sets will become less foundational and more advanced requiring more detailed data-driven analysis and review to inform decision-making.
We can t promise that it ll be easy, but we can promise that it ll be a lot of fun and you ll both learn a lot and teach us a lot along the way, too.
Responsibilities Perform integrations and automations that make Dropboxer's Macs easier to use for their day-to-day work Build and maintain desktop applications that enhance Dropboxer s user experience Proactively expand subject mastery by prioritizing continuing education through independent study, educational programs, and conference attendance Keep current on Apple and Jamf's latest product developments, capabilities, and bugs, as well as, familiarity with the competitive landscape of tooling for macOS management Plan and implement solutions for organizational problems within a company-wide cadence that cascades from annual plan, to quarterly Objective and Key Results, to 2 week sprints Assist with researching and reviewing project statements of work by identifing dependencies and prerequisites Proactively update management on deadlines, deliverables, and requirements to maintain accurate forecasting as new information is discovered Act as the technical lead for projects assigned by management Represent the Workplace Experience Team's macOS platform expertise within Dropbox's corporate environment Draft and edit documentation as part of project deliverables and keep it up-to-date with current state Cultivate cross-functional relationships with other organizations within Dropbox Model and promote a can-do, high energy, inclusive workplace that cultivates everyone's talents, strengths, curiosity, and creativity Requirements Certification in Jamf 200 or equivalent experience that demonstrates mastery of the knowledge domains covered by that certification Five years of experience shell scripting to automate systems administration workloads Five years experience working with web APIs to integrate communications between server services using a programming or scripting language other than the shell.
For example, Python, Ruby, or Swift Five years experience using source control, such as git, with CI/CD integrations for systems management applications One to three years experience writing and/or designing systems written in Swift, Objective-C, or another combination of languages Excellent presentation and writing skills to both technical and non-technical audiences in a remote environment A bachelor's degree in any field of study or equivalent post-secondary experience providing a depth and breadth of reading, writing, and problem solving experience.

As the world moves beyond mandatory work from home Dropbox is taking bold action to embrace Virtual First; a new work from anywhere paradigm.
That means our MacBooks the systems that you administer as our newest client platform engineer are Dropbox s new workplace, making what you do the foundation of how we facilitate a new workplace culture at Dropbox.
Your responsibilities will include enhancing the capabilities of a relatively new deployment of Jamf to meet our usability, telemetry, and security needs.
This includes defining and implementing the interfaces that different Dropboxers use in their day-to-day computing environment.
For most of the company that means creating a robust and useful Self Service portal For our internal support team, that means an interface that empowers them to solve problems and unblock Dropboxers whose work is impacted by an issue For our organization, that means creating an interface that hosts telemetry data that verifies the integrity and security of every system in our fleet And, for the CPE team, that means leveraging Jamf s more advanced capabilities to create an engineering workflow that bridges the gap between source control and deployment automation By joining Dropbox you ll have a specific role to fill, and will collaborate with a number of cross-functional teams to deliver high impact services to Dropboxers across the entire company.
Initially, there s a lot of foundational work to be done.
Over time, we expect that the problem sets will become less foundational and more advanced requiring more detailed data-driven analysis and review to inform decision-making.
We can t promise that it ll be easy, but we can promise that it ll be a lot of fun and you ll both learn a lot and teach us a lot along the way, too.
Responsibilities Perform integrations and automations that make Dropboxer's Macs easier to use for their day-to-day work Build and maintain desktop applications that enhance Dropboxer s user experience Proactively expand subject mastery by prioritizing continuing education through independent study, educational programs, and conference attendance Keep current on Apple and Jamf's latest product developments, capabilities, and bugs, as well as, familiarity with the competitive landscape of tooling for macOS management Plan and implement solutions for organizational problems within a company-wide cadence that cascades from annual plan, to quarterly Objective and Key Results, to 2 week sprints Assist with researching and reviewing project statements of work by identifing dependencies and prerequisites Proactively update management on deadlines, deliverables, and requirements to maintain accurate forecasting as new information is discovered Act as the technical lead for projects assigned by management Represent the Workplace Experience Team's macOS platform expertise within Dropbox's corporate environment Draft and edit documentation as part of project deliverables and keep it up-to-date with current state Cultivate cross-functional relationships with other organizations within Dropbox Model and promote a can-do, high energy, inclusive workplace that cultivates everyone's talents, strengths, curiosity, and creativity Requirements Certification in Jamf 200 or equivalent experience that demonstrates mastery of the knowledge domains covered by that certification Five years of experience shell scripting to automate systems administration workloads Five years experience working with web APIs to integrate communications between server services using a programming or scripting language other than the shell.
For example, Python, Ruby, or Swift Five years experience using source control, such as git, with CI/CD integrations for systems management applications One to three years experience writing and/or designing systems written in Swift, Objective-C, or another combination of languages Excellent presentation and writing skills to both technical and non-technical audiences in a remote environment A bachelor's degree in any field of study or equivalent post-secondary experience providing a depth and breadth of reading, writing, and problem solving experience.
Total Rewards At Dropbox, we strive to be a great place for all Dropboxers to grow and be recognized for that growth.
This job posting reflects broad requirements, and represents two potential levels of role.
Through our assessment process, we will identify your level that ties to compensation based on your experience and technical expertise along with the scope of the role.
For candidates hired in Colorado, the expected salary/On-Target Earnings (OTE) range for the role is $107,400 - $126,400 - $145,400 if you are assessed at the IC3 level.
