We are doing it again with the first live, internet-delivered TV service – Sling TV – that bucks traditional pay-TV norms and gives consumers a truly new way to access and watch television.

Now we have our sights set on upending the wireless industry and unseating the entrenched incumbent carriers.

,http://careers.dish.com/,Senior AWS DevOps Engineer,"Littleton, CO",$88K - $144K (Employer est.),"Department Summary:
DISH is a Fortune 200 company that continues to redefine the communications industry. Our legacy is innovation and a willingness to challenge the status quo, including reinventing ourselves. We disrupted the pay-TV industry in the mid-90s with the launch of the DISH satellite TV service, taking on some of the largest U.S. corporations in the process, and grew to be the fourth-largest pay-TV provider. We are doing it again with the first live, internet-delivered TV service – Sling TV – that bucks traditional pay-TV norms and gives consumers a truly new way to access and watch television.

Now we have our sights set on upending the wireless industry and unseating the entrenched incumbent carriers.

We are driven by curiosity, pride, adventure, and a desire to win – it’s in our DNA. We’re looking for people with boundless energy, intelligence, and an overwhelming need to achieve, to join our team as we embark on the next chapter of our story.

Opportunity is here. We are DISH.
