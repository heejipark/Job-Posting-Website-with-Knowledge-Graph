Specialisterne USA works with employers to help them integrate more neurodiversity into their workforce. Presently, Specialisterne USA is working with Cummins to recruit for several data science and engineering roles as part of their Neurodiversity Hiring Initiative.
Specialisterne USA provides recruitment, staffing solutions and management support to businesses interested in employing neurodiverse talent. A different perspective or an alternative communication style can be a great asset to any employer, yet because of standard recruitment processes and management practices, many people on the autism spectrum or with other neurodivergence face systematic barriers to accessing and maintaining employment. Our process is designed to avoid these barriers.
Cummins employees come from different backgrounds and experiences and aspire to a workforce that is representative at every level of the communities in which Cummins operates around the world. They are each unique in their perspectives and passions. Employees have varied experiences and personal motivations that drive them. They are united in their relentless desire to see a world, a workplace, a team where all people are embraced for who they are and what they aspire to do.",1d,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=105&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=000001846ae907bdad1ce3557d421582&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_17e00c09&cb=1668240987481&jobListingId=1008273329768&jrtk=3-0-1ghlei1v72bms001-1ghlei1vmgsro800-96780b969566853a-
