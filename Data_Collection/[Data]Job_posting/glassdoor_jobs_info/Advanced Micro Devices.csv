The Apple CPU Architecture and Performance Team is seeking highly motivated and self-driven engineers who want to live at this intersection, individuals who have or want to develop domain expertise in emerging areas like AI, individuals who have a high level CPU architecture understanding and desire to work with a world class team for CPU, SoC, and software development.

Working Title
Sr Research Scientist 1

Position Grade
14

Position Summary
The University of New Mexico (UNM) Center for High Technology Materials (CHTM) offers and exciting opportunity for a research scientist to manage its nano-fabrication facility. The CHTM nanofabrication facility comprises a four-bay cleanroom, three bays of which are Class 1000 and one bay of which is Class 100 in which metal evaporators, Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) etchers, photolithographic equipment, and other equipment are situated. Various materials characterization equipment as well as an Interferometric Lithography (IL) system are located elsewhere in the facility. All nano-fabrication and materials characterization equipment comprise the CHTM user facility at UNM that supports our micro/nano device and material research activities. Principal responsibilities will be operating, supervising operation, and maintaining all service center equipment.

CHTM was first established as one of five Centers of Technical Excellence (CTE) by the New Mexico legislature, with an initial infusion of approximately $10M in funding that was spread over the years from 1983 to 1988. The late Art Guenther, in his capacity as the Governor’s science advisor, was instrumental in shepherding the CTEs through the legislature. In 1985, Bill Streifer joined UNM as CHTM’s first Director and the research focus of the Center was initially set as high-power laser diodes. CHTM’s facilities have grown steadily over the years. In 1993, the people of New Mexico voted in favor of an educational bond issue in support of building the current 60,000 sq. ft. CHTM main building, which was completed in 1997. The extensive modern cleanroom in the main building provides capabilities for the fabrication of advanced semiconductor devices from epitaxial structures grown at CHTM. Also within the main building are nearly two dozen laboratories that house high power lasers, scanning electron microscopes, devices for molecular beam epitaxy, and advanced workstations for numerical simulations of atomic structures and beam propagation within laser cavities.

Responsibilities

Schedule and bill for services
Perform routine maintenance
Maintain cleanroom supply inventories
Instruct users in the operation and in the theory of all nano-fabrication facility equipment.
