At Sound Agriculture, we believe our food system can nourish consumers, farming communities, and the planet. Through a deeper understanding of plant and microbial biology, we are leveraging the natural power of plants to make agriculture more agile and resilient. Our work focuses on developing nutrient efficiency products and modernizing plant breeding to improve the way we farm and the food we eat. Sound is a Series C startup funded by leading investors in food and agriculture such as Leaps by Bayer, Northpond Ventures, S2G Ventures, Fall Line Capital, Cultivian Sandbox Ventures, Cavallo Ventures and Syngenta Group Ventures.
What you'll do:
We are hiring a Senior Data Scientist to accelerate development of the methods, analyses, and digital workflows that comprise the heart of Sound's discovery engine for epigenetic traits and agronomic active ingredients. Come help refine the epigenetic methods we use to develop nutritious and resilient crops – far faster than gene editing – and help us optimize our discovery pipeline for active ingredients that sustainably improve crop performance. Our aim is to unleash the power of plants to create a more agile and resilient food system, and we've gotten a great start: our product SOURCE, already being used on more than 1 million acres, stimulates already-present soil microbes to fix nitrogen so that farmers need less synthetic fertilizer. We are saving grower costs, boosting yield, and making agriculture more sustainable.
The Senior Data Scientist will help grow the organization as a combination of a hands-on developer, data architect, and expert data science practitioner with authority to make strategic decisions and lead development. The Senior Data Scientist will design, develop, enhance, maintain, and use data architecture including cloud compute services, knowledge discovery platforms, and advanced experimental automation.

Talent Acquisition Recruiter – Blue Buffalo Pet Food R&D / Supply Chain
Love them like family, feed them like family.” ® Everything at Blue Buffalo starts with this simple idea.
Blue Buffalo (BLUE), is one of the strongest and most recognized pet food brands in America, and the undisputed leader in Wholesome Natural pet food, the fastest growing segment of the market. At over four times the size of the next largest brand in this segment, BLUE has become the new mainstream brand that’s delivering products that pet parents are looking for, and connecting with them in a true, authentic way.
BLUE thinks of dogs and cats as family members and believes their food should be natural and healthy. In fact, this was the motivation for the Bishop Family’s decision to create the Blue Buffalo Company. When the beloved Bishop family dog, Blue, faced a variety of health issues, Bill and his two sons, Billy and Chris, set out to create a pet food that was made with only the highest quality natural ingredients—the kind of things a family member deserves. Fifteen years later BLUE has, in many ways, accomplished what the Bishops set out to do—help our dogs and cats live happy, healthy lives.

A high-quality catalog means there are no duplicates (there aren’t two different pages each selling the same KIND bar or two records for the blue sweater and another for the red one), and each product is enriched with copious amounts of canonical metadata (category, style, material, color, brand, price, nutritional information, length, weight, ingredients, flavor, food category, health information, etc).

"['Pew Charitable Trusts', '3.5']",https://www.pewtrusts.org/,IT/Digital Technology Spec - Career Development (Rotational) Program,"Allentown, PA",$43K - $65K (Glassdoor est.),"The Environment Portfolio at The Pew Charitable Trusts

For more than 30 years, Pew has been a major force in engaging the public and policy makers about the causes, consequences, and solutions to some of the world's most pressing environmental challenges. Our environment work spans all seven continents with more than 250 professionals working at the local, national, and international levels to reduce the scope and severity of global environmental problems, such as the erosion of large natural ecosystems that contain a great part of the world's remaining biodiversity, and the destruction of the marine environment. Pew's global environmental program focuses on science-based, nonpartisan, and sustainable solutions to help protect the planet and people. We work in partnership with governments, Indigenous rights holders, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, local stakeholders, scientists, and other researchers to advance public policy so that nature and communities can thrive.

Since 1990, Pew has worked in North America, South America and Australia to protect large and critically important terrestrial ecosystems, including rivers and other freshwater resources, coastal temperate rainforests, interior mountain ranges, the northern boreal forests, Australia's Outback, and Chilean Patagonia. We work to ensure these natural systems remain bountiful, functioning, and resilient, providing essential ecological services such as clean air and clean water, sustenance and food security for local communities and more broadly for the welfare of current and future generations. Our work relies on the sciences of conservation, sociology, biology, and economics to advocate for practical and durable solutions to the loss of biodiversity.

In the sea, reforms to how our oceans are managed are essential to address overfishing, pollution, and loss of habitat. Pew began its oceans program in the United States, focusing on ending overfishing and protecting fragile marine habitat. Starting in 2005, Pew's ocean conservation program expanded around the world and played a significant role in reforming marine fisheries management in the European Union and on the high seas and creating large scale marine reserves around the world. Our work is grounded in the best available science and pursues domestic and international conservation measures that are long-term and provide permanent, durable protections for marine ecosystems. We also work to address systemic threats to the ocean, including from plastics, over-and-illegal fishing, seabed mining, and climate change.



Conservation Support works across Pew's environment portfolio to ensure development of robust policy positions and strategy, provide specialized expertise, assist in developing and launching of new bodies of work, and provide for internal and external coordination, including coordinating Pew efforts around major international meetings.

Conservation Support is an integral part of the broader environment team, which currently focuses on establishing and improving marine protected areas; protecting ocean life on the high seas and in the deep sea; improving fisheries management, ending illegal fishing, and reducing harmful fisheries subsidies; preventing ocean plastics; protecting coastal habitats; and protecting Chilean Patagonia and Australia's Outback and oceans.


The Senior Officer, Conservation Support is a cross-cutting role that will serve as a resource on conservation finance issues across Pew's environment portfolio. They will deploy their knowledge and understanding of a variety of conservation finance approaches and their experience of developing and securing conservation financing deals to negotiate innovative financial solutions with an array of potential partners, investors, and other funding sources. This is a new position which will build Pew's capacity on conservation finance as these initiatives grow in importance.

Initial focus will be in two areas: Enduring Earth, an ambitious collaboration between The Nature Conservancy, The Pew Charitable Trusts, World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and ZOMALAB to refine and apply the Project Finance for Permanence (PFP) model to ensure durable and scalable conservation outcomes around the world; and Pew's work in securing financing streams to support coastal wetlands protection, management, and restoration in multiple countries.

The Senior Officer will report to the Project Director, Conservation Support, who is based in the Washington, DC office. This position is eligible for up to 60% telework.











Domestic and international travel expected approximately 20% of the time.



We offer a competitive salary and benefit program, including: comprehensive, affordable health care through medical, dental, and vision coverage; financial security with life and disability insurance; opportunities to save using health savings and flexible spending accounts; retirement benefits to help prepare for the future; and work/life benefits to maintain a good balance.
