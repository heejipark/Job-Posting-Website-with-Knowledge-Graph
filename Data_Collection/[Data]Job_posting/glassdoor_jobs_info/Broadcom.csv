If you are following the evolution of the leading approach in deep learning powered AI, the renaissance in NLP as well as the next disruption in computer vision, you likely know it’s all about Transformer based models.. They are powering neural nets with billions to trillions of parameters and existing silicon architectures (including the plethora of AI accelerators) are struggling to varying degrees to keep up with exploding model sizes and their performance requirements. More importantly, TCO considerations for running these models at scale are becoming a bottleneck to meet exploding demand. Hyperscalers are keen on how to gain COGS efficiencies with the trillions of AI inferences/day they are already serving, but certainly for addressing the steep demand ramp they are anticipating in the next couple of years. d-Matrix is addressing this problem head on by developing a fully digital in memory computing accelerator for AI inference that is highly optimized for the computational patterns in Transformers. The fully digital approach removes some of the difficulties of analog techniques that are most often touted in pretty much all other in-memory computing AI inference products. d-Matrix’s AI inference accelerator has also been architected as a chiplet, thereby enabling both a scale-up and scale-out solution with flexible packaging options. The d-Matrix team has a stellar track record in developing and commercializing silicon at scale as senior execs at the likes of Inphi, Broadcom, and Intel. Notably, they recognized early the extremely important role of programmability and the software stack and are thoughtfully building up the team in this area even since before their Series A.

['d-Matrix'],http://www.matrix-butikerna.se/,AI/ML Systems - Senior/Staff/Principal SW Engineer,"Santa Clara, CA",$92K - $153K (Glassdoor est.),"About us

If you are following the evolution of the leading approach in deep learning powered AI, the renaissance in NLP as well as the next disruption in computer vision, you likely know it’s all about Transformer based models.. They are powering neural nets with billions to trillions of parameters and existing silicon architectures (including the plethora of AI accelerators) are struggling to varying degrees to keep up with exploding model sizes and their performance requirements. More importantly, TCO considerations for running these models at scale are becoming a bottleneck to meet exploding demand. Hyperscalers are keen on how to gain COGS efficiencies with the trillions of AI inferences/day they are already serving, but certainly for addressing the steep demand ramp they are anticipating in the next couple of years. d-Matrix is addressing this problem head on by developing a fully digital in memory computing accelerator for AI inference that is highly optimized for the computational patterns in Transformers. The fully digital approach removes some of the difficulties of analog techniques that are most often touted in pretty much all other in-memory computing AI inference products. d-Matrix’s AI inference accelerator has also been architected as a chiplet, thereby enabling both a scale-up and scale-out solution with flexible packaging options. The d-Matrix team has a stellar track record in developing and commercializing silicon at scale as senior execs at the likes of Inphi, Broadcom, and Intel. Notably, they recognized early the extremely important role of programmability and the software stack and are thoughtfully building up the team in this area even since before their Series A. The company has raised $44m in funding so far and has 70+ employees across Silicon Valley, Sydney and Bengaluru.",3d,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=101&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=000001846a544ab8aa0880390e66863d&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_538634fa&cb=1668231228562&jobListingId=1008266027105&jrtk=3-0-1ghl58infkcmf801-1ghl58invihlq800-d5ba716c9abdd640-
