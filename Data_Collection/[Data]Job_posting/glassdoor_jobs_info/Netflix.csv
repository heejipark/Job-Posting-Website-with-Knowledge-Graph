What’s the opportunity about?*
For our AI department, we are looking for a product manager that empowers our product teams to solve hard problems in ways that our customers love, yet work for our business.
Our product teams are cross-functional and durable, generally composed of a product manager, a product designer, a dev lead and several engineers, often complemented by an expert linguist and/or an AI lead.
We staff our product teams with the skills necessary to come up with effective solutions that are valuable (our customers choose to buy or use), viable (the solution works within the many constraints of the business), usable (the user can figure out how to use) and feasible (our engineers have the skills and technology to implement).
While the product designer is accountable for ensuring the solution is usable, and the dev lead is accountable for ensuring the solution is feasible, the product manager is accountable for ensuring the solution is both valuable and viable.
This means that the product manager must contribute to the product team a deep knowledge of our users and customers, and the data about how our customers engage with our products. The product manager must also contribute to the product team a solid knowledge of the various constraints of the business – constraints from marketing, sales, service, finance, legal, and privacy are typical examples. Finally, the product manager is expected to track industry trends and the competitive landscape as they pertain to their product.
The product manager must collaborate closely with their product designer, dev lead, AI lead, and linguists to discover effective solutions, and then work together to deliver those solutions to market.
While we empower our product teams to figure out the best solutions to the most important problems that need to be solved, we also hold those teams accountable for the results. We look for product managers that are not afraid of signing up for results, even when this means they have to work through others to achieve the necessary results.
This job, as with the other roles on the product team, is an individual contributor role.
You will need to be able to influence your teammates, as well as colleagues, stakeholders, and key executives, through your use of data and logic so they become straight supporters of our team's initiatives.

We call the set of services delivering this ""MDES” - Mastercard Digital Enablement System. We’ve experienced incredible success and growth, with 10s of billions of transactions being processed each year, however now we are focusing on ensuring the success continues as we scale MDES even further.

Our teams and values:

Our back story:

Mastercard was first to introduce contactless card payments in 2001; and soon after in only 2002 introduced the first mobile phone contactless payment. Twenty years ago! A decade later, Mastercard’s mobile payment application and MDES enabled the introduction of Apple Pay, followed shortly after by Google Pay and Samsung Pay. In the almost ten years since, mobile payments on the Mastercard network have grown to tens of billions of transactions a year and there are many more “- Pay” digital wallet options available, all over the world.

MDES is also securing your cards on file with merchants such as Netflix and Amazon, so that card information is replaced by tokenized data and every transaction is cryptographically secured using similar technology to those used in digital wallets. It also secures the cards in “Click To Pay”, the new way of making online payments safer that is supported by Mastercard and all the other payment networks.
