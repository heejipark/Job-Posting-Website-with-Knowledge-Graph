At Ford, the health and safety of our employees is our top priority. Vaccination has been proven to play a critical role in combatting COVID-19. As a result, Ford has made the decision to require U.S. salaried employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, unless employees require an accommodation for religious or medical reasons. Being fully vaccinated means that an individual is at least two weeks past their final dose of an authorized COVID-19 vaccine regimen. As a condition of employment, newly hired employees will be required to provide proof of their COVID-19 vaccination or an approved medical or religious exemption.",30d+,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=115&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=000001846a484ea48ec9d9dcbeef4207&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_69924743&cb=1668230485316&jobListingId=1008060091721&jrtk=3-0-1ghl4gjmai16u801-1ghl4gjmrghqu800-06f970245fb5db89-

Ford’s IT organization is broadening its focus within the area of Embedded Cyber Security in the automotive environment. We are both researching and reviewing new enterprise-wide features and technologies, as well as providing frameworks, processes and tools to help the research.
Technology is advancing, connection mechanisms are growing, and consumers and hackers are becoming more sophisticated. With increasing networking between modules and access points into the vehicle it has increased thereby opening up new potential vulnerabilities. Automobiles are no longer mere mechanical devices but are controlled by dozens of digital computers coordinated by internal networks. While all this technology has allowed for better personalized experiences, seamless integration into a person’s lifestyle, differential services, predictive diagnostics and safer driving conditions, the increase in complexity drives the need for advanced security and data solutions.
We are expanding the role of advanced embedded computing platforms, coupled with cloud-based services, to deliver applications which will redefine the experience of owning, maintaining, driving and interacting with Ford Motor Company vehicles. Security needs to be built into each of these growing technologies.
The In-Vehicle Cybersecurity Engineer will act as a technical lead designing security into our vehicles. Engineers will evaluate, critique, and drive secure designs from concept to implementation. In-Vehicle Cybersecurity Engineers identify new methods of securing our technologies from drafting specifications to completing testing.
Engineers need to be able to understand and evaluate risk for in-vehicle systems. Recognizing and accommodating the limitations of embedded in-vehicle systems is important. Engineers are expected to take ownership of assignments including developing in-depth understanding of the technologies under review, working to close security gaps and mitigate identified vulnerabilities, and report out to security management. Over time, Engineers will grow to become domain authorities acting to develop and mature security controls and features in the vehicle.
As part of the Ford family, you will enjoy excellent compensation and a comprehensive benefits package that includes generous PTO, retirement, savings and stock investment plans, incentive compensation and much more.
