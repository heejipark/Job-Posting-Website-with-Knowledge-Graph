Across Lockheed Martin, and the defense industry, there’s a fourth industrial revolution occurring. Customers are looking for companies to address their needs faster, produce prototypes sooner, and remain price competitive. Digital transformation is the answer. At its core, digital transformation means taking manual, labor intensive processes and upgrading the tools, format, or processes themselves to complete them faster and with greater insight. It's not something that will be done for us, but something that we all must do together to ensure FBM's legacy of excellence continues for generations.

As a member of the FBM Transformation & Training Excellence Organization, you’ll be responsible to
plan, conduct, and coordinate software development activities for digital transformation and modernization of the FBM Program. You will design, develop, document, test, and debug software that contains logical and mathematical solutions to business/mission problems or questions in computer language for solutions by means of data processing equipment. All work shall apply the appropriate standards, processes, procedures, and tools throughout the development life cycle. In addition, all work shall apply knowledge of computer hardware and software, subject matter to be programmed in business/mission applications, information processing techniques used, and information gathered from system users to develop software. Throughout each project lifecycle, you will correct program errors, prepare operating instructions, compile documentation of program development, and analyze system capabilities to resolve questions of program intent, output requirements, input data acquisition, programming techniques, and controls. And finally, ensure software standards are met. Continuous communications with IS team and Digital Transformation team is crucial to success in this role. The FBM transformation team is looking for motivated individuals that can communicate effectively to help bridge the program from sustainment of yesterday to development and sustainment for continual improvement throughout the lifecycle of the program.

We need skirmishers. We need engineers with scars they've gained over the course of many successes and failures. We need people that know how to get things done. We need people that know how to inspire and lead.

This job is in a new, growing, well-organized program. We incorporate many of the latest technologies and practices of industry, evaluating and adopting them as possible. Meetings over an hour are very rare and we keep work life-balance in check (because we plan to avoid heroics).

You will not be programming just another database, another website, another monolith, another MVP, another HR system, another financial system... you will be doing really cool things, that have an impact. This is not a boring, stuffy job you might expect at a large company. We use cool tech and process and we even try to make work comfortable. We just need good people like you.

Do you fear missing your foosball table, your pool table, your cool office furniture, your refrigerator of snacks, to life in a big company? Well, we don't have a pool table (foosball we do!), but we realize the impact conveniences like snacks and coffee have on employee happiness so we keep those stocked. We have windows too! All small things that make a difference.

Our culture supports employees to dream big, perform with excellence and create incredible products. We provide the resources, encouragement and focus and if you have the passion, we want to build a better tomorrow with you!


You will serve as a software developer (DevOps-ish) looking to improve process and solve problems for a large and growing program. We triage problems (ensuring we have a good understanding of the program needs), then automate where we can and provide tools where we can't. You will be on an Agile Kanban team with surprising control of it's own priorities. The job is a mix of tools, process, people and practical solutions (ex. We used ASCII art to increase people noticing error messages and warnings). The program is centered on Kubernetes, Helm and Gitlab CI/CD with languages including Java, JavaScript and Python. We strive for quantified approaches to prioritization where possible. You will be working on a mission that you can be proud of, knowing that you are making a lasting difference in the world and in the Space domain.

As a Dev Sec Ops Engineer, you are an integral part of the F-35 Common Reprogramming Tool (CRT) team. The F-35 CRT is a very large software application that is in the early stages of development. It will be used by our F-35 customer Reprogramming Labs to generate the Mission Data File (MDF) sets which are pivotal to implementation of effective missions and overall operation of the F-35 aircraft. After completion of the initial CRT delivery, development will continue with enhancements for complex follow through and data analysis that will continue to enable the leading edge technology that supports our customers' future needs.

A great candidate would enjoy learning new technologies, developing subject matter expertise, and working with collaborative Agile teams to create innovative experiences. This is a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a new product, performing software development in a DevOps environment to build the modernized CRT application and expand on its capabilities to enable future technologies.

The candidate will help mature CRT's DevSecOps implementation and have a strong desire to automate processes rather than doing them twice. The candidate will leverage the latest DevSecOps tools and methodologies to deliver value to our customers quickly, efficiently, and repeatedly.

Description:What You Really Want to Know:
We need skirmishers. We need engineers with scars they’ve gained over the course of many successes and failures. We need people that know how to get things done. We need people that know how to inspire and lead.

This job is in a new, growing, well-organized program. We incorporate many of the latest technologies and practices of industry, evaluating and adopting them as possible. Meetings over an hour are very rare and we keep work life-balance in check (because we plan to avoid heroics).

You will not be programming just another database, another website, another monolith, another MVP, another HR system, another financial system… you will be doing really cool things, that have an impact. This is not a boring, stuffy job you might expect at a large company. We use cool tech and process and we even try to make work comfortable. We just need good people like you.

Do you fear missing your foosball table, your pool table, your cool office furniture, your refrigerator of snacks, to life in a big company? Well, we don’t have a pool table (foosball we do!), but we realize the impact conveniences like snacks and coffee have on employee happiness so we keep those stocked. We have windows too! All small things that make a difference.

Our amazing people are on a mission to make a difference in the world and every day we use our outstanding skills and experiences to create, craft and build solutions to some of the worlds’ hardest engineering problems. Our culture supports employees to dream big, perform with excellence and create incredible products. We provide the resources, encouragement and focus and if you have the passion, we want to build a better tomorrow with you!


You will serve as a software developer (DevOps-ish) looking to improve process and solve problems for a large and growing program. We triage problems (ensuring we have a good understanding of the program needs), then automate where we can and provide tools where we can’t. You will be on an Agile Kanban team with surprising control of it’s own priorities. The job is a mix of tools, process, people and practical solutions (ex. We used ASCII art to increase people noticing error messages and warnings). The program is centered on Kubernetes, Helm and Gitlab CI/CD with languages including Java, JavaScript and Python. We strive for quantified approaches to prioritization where possible. You will be working on a mission that you can be proud of, knowing that you are making a lasting difference in the world and in the Space domain.
