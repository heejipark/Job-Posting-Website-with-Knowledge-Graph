Job Summary Tier 2 security engineers are responsible for ensuring the day to day activities of the SOC are maintained in accordance with processes and procedures while ensuring the quality of customer service and MDR is exemplary. They help instruct the Tier 1 security analysts and leads as necessary including: niche troubleshooting that is beyond the scope or expertise of the first two levels of escalation, gather metrics to quantify and qualify operations performance and efficiency, and look for ways to improve processes and procedures to increase analyst effectiveness and efficiency.
Job Description
Core Responsibilities

They have to be able to perform a broad range of competencies to include: presentations, auditing, training, mentoring, consultation, technical skills, and broad adaptation and mastery of security tools used by the SOC. They occasionally will have vaguely defined tasks and must be able to generate and evaluate work to provide for the needs of the analysts below them.

Tier 2 engineers are responsible for identifying issues with SOC operations and working with analysts and senior engineers to resolve the issues. This may take the form of new processes and procedures, new MDR techniques, and exploring new technologies, or using existing technologies in more creative ways.

They will also work closely with the senior engineers to create bugs and help them understand the issues and what solutions have already been applied. This can require providing detailed explanations and working sessions to help support the senior engineers if projects need to be escalated.

Tier 2 engineers should be subject matter experts for one or more of our product offerings and be competent in supporting others, such as scanning, Splunk/Elastic, CASB, Fortigate to name a few.

A tier 2 engineer is also responsible for mentoring the tier 1 and shift leads in all varieties of technical and customer service related activities. They are expected to be able to organize and outline training content: holding regular training with their leads, review training content for senior tier 2 to disseminate, and ensure that training on new processes, procedures, and other troubleshooting material is passed on to all analysts.

Tier 2 analysts are also responsible for handling escalations from the SOC, growing their repertoire to solve issues as often as possible before escalating further up the chain. They should be organized and track all escalations they are working on, handing off repetitive escalations to lower tiers, informing senior engineers/management of what escalations they are having to deal with, and working closely with senior engineers to solve complicated issues and grow their ability to handle more complex matters. This also requires a solid understanding of time management to stay on task, understand when to automate or delegate, and when to get help.

Helps ensure that customer SLAs are met at all times. Responds quickly to downtime situations.
Communicates regularly with development and supports teams regarding system status and implementation schedules.
Consistent exercise of independent judgment and discretion in matters of significance.

Public pension reform is one of the most significant fiscal challenges facing states and municipalities today. In fact, our research shows that as of 2016, state governments had pension debts totaling $1.4 trillion. Although some plans are well-funded, in other places, if changes are not made, retirees, workers, and taxpayers will be left with rising costs and unpaid promises for years to come.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Every state and municipality has a unique set of policy preferences and budgetary challenges. Given the high stakes for states' budgets and workers, policy makers need trusted information and guidance to help them consider possible options, understand what is known about each, then make decisions based on the best available information. This project will work with states to examine their challenges and help policy makers consider data-driven policies that result in sustainable retirement systems while maintaining states' ability to recruit and retain skilled workers.

Specifically, the project will:

The ideal candidate has a background in public policy or related field with experience collecting and synthesizing data and research to produce effective and clear written materials useful to policy makers and/or the public. Background in data collection, extensive analysis, solid written and verbal communication skills is desired. Finally, interest in working on fiscal policy issues is key; however, familiarity with state or federal budget challenges or procedures and knowledge of public sector retirement and benefit systems is a plus, but not necessary.


Working collaboratively across a team of researchers, policy analysts, reporters, and communications professionals, help develop and implement research-including but not limited to 50-state assessments and state-specific analyses-on public sector retirement benefits. Contribute constructively at every stage of the project, including:

What we're tackling
Rundoo exists to improve the marketplace for building materials. There are ~$1,000,000,000,000 of building materials bought every year in the US (a full 5% of US GDP is just transacting materials!), and the vast majority of these transactions happen over the phone or in-person and then live in 40-year-old point-of-sale (POS) systems. We've built a marketplace for contractors to order that is growing 40% m/m and are now building a POS for suppliers for seven signed clients later this year with the eventual goal of becoming the de facto POS for building material suppliers! If we're successful, it will be more affordable and safer to build.
