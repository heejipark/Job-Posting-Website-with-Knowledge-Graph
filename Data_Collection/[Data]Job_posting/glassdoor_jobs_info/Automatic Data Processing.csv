The Washington State Department of Health acknowledges that our locations statewide are on the homelands of Native people, who have lived in this region from time immemorial. Currently, within the boundaries of Washington State, there are 36 tribes, 29 of which are federally recognized, that share traditional homelands and waterways in what is now Washington State. Some of these are nations and confederacies that represent multiple tribes or bands. We express our most profound respect for and gratitude toward these original and current caretakers of the region. As a public health agency, we acknowledge our responsibility to establish and maintain relationships with these tribes and Native peoples, in support of tribal sovereignty and the inclusion of their voices in public health programs and policies.

:
Tumwater is a vibrant city just south of Olympia, the state's capital, with a small-town feel conveniently situated in the Puget Sound area between Seattle and Portland. The rugged Olympic Mountains rise in the distance, and Mount Rainier seems close enough to touch on a clear day. Tumwater enjoys the benefits of an engaged and educated community and a well-supported school system, with two universities and a community college within a ten-mile radius.

Tumwater is in Thurston County, Washington, homelands of the Coast Salish Peoples, including those recognized today as the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation, and the Nisqually and Squaxin Indian Tribes. We acknowledge their presence here since time immemorial and recognize their continuing connection to the land, to the water, and to their ancestors.
