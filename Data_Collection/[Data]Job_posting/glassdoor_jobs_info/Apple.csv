Imagine what you could do here. At Apple, new ideas have a way of becoming extraordinary products, services, and customer experiences very quickly. Bring passion and dedication to your job and there's no telling what you could accomplish. The people here at Apple don’t just craft products - they build the kind of wonder that’s revolutionized entire industries. Apple University provides wide-ranging and outstanding educational programs for Apple employees. Through our original curricula, we strive to cultivate deeper understanding, critical reflection, and engaged discussion about Apple’s culture, organization, and values, and about the social context and public culture in which Apple works. To advance these daring aims, Apple University crafts and delivers original classes, tools, workshops, and media. These offerings help encourage intellectual curiosity, sustain debate, and build thoughtful and informed leadership throughout the company. The University team includes faculty from academia, with deep expertise in select subject areas, as well as faculty who previously held leadership roles within Apple and were drawn to instruct. They work with the Production team, which includes the broad areas of expertise required to develop, produce, and deliver all of the offerings listed above. Designers within Apple University work side-by-side faculty, content producers, and the program team, to bring all of our materials to life. They use the power of design to clarify, connect, and surprise. Senior designers operate at multiple levels — crafting the structure and form of materials and getting into the details of the deliverable. They do this across a breadth of media, including websites, presentations, documents, videos, and apps. As part of the university, designers and creators who excel will find engagement in the ideas and thinking that underlie our work — they will obsess over how to convey it simply, beautifully, and in a way that engages others in reflection and discussion.",28d,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=123&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=0000018469310343a1ce1e6824f454c5&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_6599fde3&cb=1668212207106&jobListingId=1008207258335&jrtk=3-0-1ghkj20sdia3o801-1ghkj20svg2ec800-9831423911936692-
