At IBM, work is more than a job - it's a calling: To build. To design. To code. To consult. To think along with clients and sell. To make markets. To invent. To collaborate. Not just to do something better, but to attempt things you've never thought possible. Are you ready to lead in this new era of technology and solve some of the world's most challenging problems? If so, lets talk.

Your Role and Responsibilities
As a Hardware Design Technician Apprentice at IBM, you will learn the mechanical packaging and design of electronic sub-assemblies (power, thermal, IO, planar boards, interconnect frames, brackets, covers etc.) that make up our z and Power systems using three dimensional (3D) CAD tools like Catia, Creo and Solidworks.

Throughout your apprenticeship, you’ll work closely with experienced engineers and mentors where you will apply your learning to design parts, assemble early hardware builds and perform application verification testing. You will have hands on experience with prototypes, troubleshooting field fails and implementing fixes, operating measurement and machining equipment (e.g. 3D printer) and other functions performed by the mechanical design team.


IBM Apprenticeship Program is an official registered apprenticeship recognized by the Department of Labor (DOL). Every graduate of a Registered Apprenticeship program receives a nationally-recognized credential from the DOL.

During the apprenticeship duration, you will be required to complete specific learning hours and on the job training that has been outlined to ensure you are developing the skills and competencies essential to the role. You will be able to learn and grow at your own pace, but we expect most apprentices will complete their learning within 12 months. Once you graduate and receive your certificate from our apprentice program, you will be eligible to apply to available full-time roles at IBM.


An apprenticeship is about learning. We’re seeking candidates who have the following requirements, but we know you’re just getting your career started, and we’re committed to helping you learn and grow. If you’ve had some experience with data analysis or simply working in a team oriented environment in the past, you’re exactly the type of candidate we’re looking for.



As an apprentice, you'll join with other apprentices in a local cohort. You'll go through your first few weeks together, learning about IBM and the skills you'll be attaining throughout your apprenticeship. Then, you'll work with your managers and mentors to progress through your personal skills roadmap, learning and demonstrating new knowledge and competencies through hands-on application with your project teams.

Apprentices must be based in the work location(s) listed or willing to relocate. Relocation assistance is not available.
