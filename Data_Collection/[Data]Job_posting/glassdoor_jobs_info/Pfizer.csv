Job summary
Would you like to implement innovative cloud computing solutions and solve the world's most complex technical problems? Do you have a deep passion and desire to engineer and operate the world's largest cloud computing infrastructure to build a better world for future generations?

This is an exciting opportunity to use the latest cloud computing technologies to help U.S. Government agencies implement innovative cloud computing solutions and solve technical problems.

AWS established a specialized group of service teams responsible for the work we are doing with the U.S. Intelligence Community. We are building some of the largest and most complex distributed systems in the world, and we need adaptable people to help us implement and operate them.

The AWS Route 53 ADC Ops team is seeking highly motivated engineers who are focused on operational excellence and troubleshooting complex system operations, have a good understanding of Linux, networking, and general knowledge of cloud services. We need engineers who understand how to think big, and simplify solutions to complex problems; all the while ensuring that our customers continue to have the best experience possible.

You will be able to take a defined project, break down the work to help define milestones, and feedback mechanisms. You identify when implementations are not highly available or have defects; you investigate systemic patterns. You resolve, mitigate, or escalate operational concerns in a timely manner.

Mentorship & Career Growth
We are committed to supporting our new team members through a broad mix of Amazon experience, expertise, and tenures. We celebrate knowledge, sharing, and mentorship.

Work Life Balance
Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead, we’re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and well-balanced life—both in and outside of work.

Other Requirements
This position requires that the candidate selected be a U.S. citizen and must currently possess an active Top Secret security clearance. The position further requires that, after start, the selected candidate obtain and maintain an active TS/SCI security clearance with polygraph and satisfy other security related requirements.

In compliance with the U.S. government requirement that employees of its contractors, and employees who work on or in connection with U.S government contracts must receive the COVID-19 vaccine, this position may require that the candidate selected be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. A person is considered fully vaccinated by completing the full regimen of the COVID-19 vaccine (two doses for Pfizer or Moderna and one dose for Johnson & Johnson).

Position may be located in Annapolis Junction, MD 20701, Seattle, WA 98101, Herndon, VA 20170, Arlington, VA 22202 or Denver, CO 80202. Relocation assistance would be offered (pending qualification guidelines).

The pay range for this position in Colorado is $91,000 - $152000, however, base pay offered may vary depending on job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. A sign-on bonus, clearance bonus, and restricted stock units may be provided as part of the compensation package, in addition to a full range of medical, financial, and/or other benefits, dependent on the position offered. This information is provided per the Colorado Equal Pay Act. Base pay information is based on market location. Applicants should apply via Amazon’s internal or external careers site.

Key job responsibilities
Ensure Route 53 is able to offer customers a fast change propagation and 100% uptime SLA. We do this through deploying software, troubleshooting software failures, and minimizing the need for human involvements through automation such as infrastructure as code and operator tools.



A day in the life
It’s always Day 1 at Amazon. On a typical day, a Route 53 ADC Engineer manages and monitors systems in air-gapped regions. This would involve deep diving anomalies, addressing scaling needs, and using this data to ensure our services maintain a 100% uptime SLA! We do all this through existing tools and when required, we build or update tools typically written in Python or Ruby. The most exciting part of this role is working to deploy and build the latest Route 53 features and software releases for our air-gapped customers.",30d+,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=111&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=000001846b7aa5bcb6f601ca6e842027&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_fb01ceda&cb=1668250548051&jobListingId=1007689154653&jrtk=3-0-1ghlnl9ffma7m801-1ghlnl9g0grgj800-d481f8baa8e0b3f6-

As an engineer on the SRE team, you’ll build capabilities that enable our team to ship code with ever-increasing speed, security, durability, and observability. We believe in experimenting with ideas as long as it makes our teams work faster, and improves quality and stability . As one of the first engineering hires on the team, you’ll have the opportunity to help guide technical direction and culture, grow the team, and see your contributions make immediate impact.

Overall, we’re a small team (more of a startup than a telco team), but growing rapidly and frequently punch above our weight. We operate within a (mostly) flat org so your growth opportunities are entirely up to you - we’ll be there to support you along the way.
