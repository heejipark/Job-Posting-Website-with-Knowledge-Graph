Service Forester, Natural Resource Specialist 2
Recruitment #2022-11-A130
Full-time, Non-permanent, Represented positions
Anticipated 18 month Non-permanent employment: December 2022 – May 2024
Location: Northeast Region- Omak, WA.

Want to join something GREAT and make a difference?
The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Northeast Region is searching for a Service Forester in our Okanogan County area. We are looking for an individual who is a proven team player, has experience in forestry, forest health and fire suppression and displays an effective form of leadership to deliver program goals to local landowners.

The local work unit is dominated by pine stands in desperate need of treatments to promote forest health, reduce fuel loading and protect structures. Since 2020, hundreds of people have purchased open lands within the work unit in hopes of building their dream houses and often times these places are overrun with pine thickets and overcrowded forests in poor health. This position will help to support the private landowners in protecting their dream and the surrounding communities. Thousands of existing homes and properties are losing the battle every year trying to manage the forest that never stops growing. The Service Forester’s decisions on timber and biomass management are very important and can certainly put a property on a better trajectory of good forest health which is a cornerstone goal of the program.

The Service Forester position will report to the Sr. Service Foresters (NRS3) and will require the ability to foster positive working relationships amongst the other Service Foresters in the county and region, while also interacting with the general public, contractors, fire districts and other state, local, county and federal agencies on a routine basis. This position will require the successful candidate to exercise their knowledge of forestry, forest health, fire behavior, structural protection, agreement negotiation and communication skills. By performing these actions effectively, efficiently and professionally, this position supports the DNR in fulfilling its mission of providing innovative leadership and expertise to ensure environmental protection, community safety and a rich quality of life for current and future generations.",4d,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=121&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=000001846b7046659bc1bcf432ecf792&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_4cc90fd7&cb=1668249899745&jobListingId=1008263334272&jrtk=3-0-1ghln0hllma52801-1ghln0hm6itnc800-17d498b7b30d8027-
