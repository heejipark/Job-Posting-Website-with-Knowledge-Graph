Miami, United States of America

WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING

USA Job Function Description: Responsible for designing, developing, implementing and updating electronic data systems in accordance with the needs of the company. Activities include evaluating, scheduling and resourcing development projects, investigating user needs, writing, testing and maintaining computer programs, and preparing systems documentation. Executes technical plans, system analysis, detailed design specifications, development, unit and component testing.

This person is a tech lead as a part of an application development team whose primary focus is in creating, maintaining, and automating regression test harnesses which validate a large and complex suite of batch-based business process and ETL jobs. There are scores of interrelated job cycles of interest—some of which take input from third parties, some of which operate on user input, and some of which operate on a feedback loop of the output of a previous cycle. The jobs are automated in production through various schedulers or through application workflow. Some are time-triggered, and some are event-triggered. A person in this role will be able to use existing documentation and data models and—above all—will be able to read code (C#, T-SQL, PowerShell, Windows Shell, and job scripting) in order to reverse-engineer the jobs including data dependencies. Based off of that analysis, a person in this role would be able to engineer test harness scripts driven through a scripted language such as Python which would set up the necessary test data, run partial job cycles, and then compare the test results to expected values. Beyond partial job cycles, this engineer will be able to set up complete test cycles in non-production environments to mirror exact realistic production cycles.

This person will work together with incumbent data engineers, batch operations analysts, application SMEs, and DBAs. This person may also need to work with technical resources at third-party partner organizations in order to gather specifications for data sent by or sent to said partner. Finally, they will closely partner with QA and UAT teams in order to tie together test cycles and to make sure that the test cases being run are in service towards the new features being built.

Furthermore, this person will work together with business analysts in order to properly document the results of reverse-engineering expeditions in case such documentation is lacking.

To be successful in this role, this engineer must be able to fluidly follow data across a tech stack of multiple different languages. In addition to traditional C# application development knowledge, experience with ETL and enterprise scheduling toolsets is a must-have. Experience analyzing data sets in order to create realistic test data is important. Experience with partner integration would be a big asset.

This person will be expected to be organized and self-starting. S/he may receive ambiguous tasks or code to dig into and will be expected to own the task from start to finish.

In the role as a lead, this person will be responsible for helping to guide and mentor less-experienced developers on the team. S/he will perform desk checks and reviews of code and design and will therefore help enforce adherence to team standards and best practices. This person will also be somebody who can start with a blank whiteboard and a problem statement and work with a team to architect a solution that solves said problem.

To perform this job successfully, an individual must be able to perform each essential duty satisfactorily. The requirements listed below are representative of the knowledge, skill, and/or ability required. Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.


Bachelor's Degree or equivalent work experience


Information Technology, Technical Application Development, or similar experience.


Strong communication and presentation skills, as well as strong/proven management skills.
Ability to continually assess and evaluate the impact of emerging technologies against the strategic business needs and interpret business value for the leadership team in a consultative capacity.

Proven understanding of Computer Science fundamentals including web development, service-oriented architecture, cloud computing, test driven development and domain driven design.
Strong services oriented architecture experience.
Ability to lead multiple sub-teams through example and persuasion.
Ability to manage multiple projects at the same time.
Additional Required Skills
C#/Java/other object-oriented language
SQL procedure programming (could be SQL Server, Oracle, or other RDBMS)
of a scripting language (PowerShell, Python, Perl, Ruby, COMAL, etc.)
Experience performing design and code reviews
Experience mentoring more junior engineers/developers
Experience with an enterprise scheduler such as Control-M, ESP, or AutoSys
Experience with an ETL toolset such as Informatica or SSIS
Experience creating automated regression testbeds, including creating meaningful input test data
Experience with scrubbing or anonymizing of private identifying information in a sensitive dataset
Experience with reading and creating entity relationship diagrams, data flow diagrams, and data architecture diagrams
Preferred Skills
Experience working with third-party teams, such as on a partner integration project
Experience with ticketing systems like ServiceNow, BMC, JIRA
Experience with Splunk
Experience working alongside a QA team or with Test First Development may help quite a bit
