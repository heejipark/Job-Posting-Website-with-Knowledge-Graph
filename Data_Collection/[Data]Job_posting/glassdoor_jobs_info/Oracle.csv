The RiskPS BizOps team is looking for a Site Reliability Engineer who can help us solve problems, implement automation, and leverage best practices.

Business Operations is leading the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) transformation at Mastercard through our tooling and by being an advocate for change & standards throughout the development, quality, release, and product organizations. We need team members with an appetite for change and pushing the boundaries of what can be done with automation.

Mission

The role of business operations is to be the production readiness steward for the platform.

Biz Ops teams also focus on risk management by tying all our activities together with an overarching responsibility for compliance and risk mitigation across all our environments. A biz ops focus is also on streamlining and standardizing traditional application specific support activities and centralizing points of interaction for both internal and external partners by communicating effectively with all key stakeholders.

Ultimately, the role of biz ops is to align Product and Customer Focused priorities with Operational needs.

Almost all the roles I work on have a social fit component as well as a technical skill component. This role is no different. So, you might ask 'so, Tom, what creates a social fit here?'. Well, I am glad you asked. Here are the some of those characteristics:",7d,
