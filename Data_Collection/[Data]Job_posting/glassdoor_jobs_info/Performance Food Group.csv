We are hiring a Senior Data Scientist to accelerate development of the methods, analyses, and digital workflows that comprise the heart of Sound's discovery engine for epigenetic traits and agronomic active ingredients. Come help refine the epigenetic methods we use to develop nutritious and resilient crops – far faster than gene editing – and help us optimize our discovery pipeline for active ingredients that sustainably improve crop performance. Our aim is to unleash the power of plants to create a more agile and resilient food system, and we've gotten a great start: our product SOURCE, already being used on more than 1 million acres, stimulates already-present soil microbes to fix nitrogen so that farmers need less synthetic fertilizer. We are saving grower costs, boosting yield, and making agriculture more sustainable.
The Senior Data Scientist will help grow the organization as a combination of a hands-on developer, data architect, and expert data science practitioner with authority to make strategic decisions and lead development. The Senior Data Scientist will design, develop, enhance, maintain, and use data architecture including cloud compute services, knowledge discovery platforms, and advanced experimental automation. We currently work across AWS services (S3, Nextflow, docker), on-site genomic data generation (Oxford Nanopore), SaaS LIMS, and ML models running on custom high performance computing, with increasing levels of automation and abstraction. We democratize analysis using custom microservices, jupyter notebooks, and stats/viz packages like JMP. This role will help determine what's next.
The Senior Data Scientist role reports to the Director, Data Science and will interact with functions across the company as a project and team lead.

"['Sound Agriculture', '4.7']",http://www.sound.ag/,Data Scientist,"Philadelphia, NY",$108K - $193K (Employer est.),"Why you should join us:
At Sound Agriculture, we believe our food system can nourish consumers, farming communities, and the planet. Through a deeper understanding of plant and microbial biology, we are leveraging the natural power of plants to make agriculture more agile and resilient. Our work focuses on developing nutrient efficiency products and modernizing plant breeding to improve the way we farm and the food we eat. Sound is a Series C startup funded by leading investors in food and agriculture such as Leaps by Bayer, Northpond Ventures, S2G Ventures, Fall Line Capital, Cultivian Sandbox Ventures, Cavallo Ventures and Syngenta Group Ventures.
What you'll do:
We are hiring a Senior Data Scientist to accelerate development of the methods, analyses, and digital workflows that comprise the heart of Sound's discovery engine for epigenetic traits and agronomic active ingredients. Come help refine the epigenetic methods we use to develop nutritious and resilient crops – far faster than gene editing – and help us optimize our discovery pipeline for active ingredients that sustainably improve crop performance. Our aim is to unleash the power of plants to create a more agile and resilient food system, and we've gotten a great start: our product SOURCE, already being used on more than 1 million acres, stimulates already-present soil microbes to fix nitrogen so that farmers need less synthetic fertilizer. We are saving grower costs, boosting yield, and making agriculture more sustainable.
The Senior Data Scientist will help grow the organization as a combination of a hands-on developer, data architect, and expert data science practitioner with authority to make strategic decisions and lead development. The Senior Data Scientist will design, develop, enhance, maintain, and use data architecture including cloud compute services, knowledge discovery platforms, and advanced experimental automation. We currently work across AWS services (S3, Nextflow, docker), on-site genomic data generation (Oxford Nanopore), SaaS LIMS, and ML models running on custom high performance computing, with increasing levels of automation and abstraction. We democratize analysis using custom microservices, jupyter notebooks, and stats/viz packages like JMP. This role will help determine what's next.
The Senior Data Scientist role reports to the Director, Data Science and will interact with functions across the company as a project and team lead. This role is a hybrid onsite position based in our Emeryville, CA headquarters.",10d,www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=128&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=0000018469d7584b94204188f498d169&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_9419551a&cb=1668223123956&jobListingId=1008250612569&jrtk=3-0-1ghktem4fkujg801-1ghktem4v24hh000-baeab97c6a1472a1-
