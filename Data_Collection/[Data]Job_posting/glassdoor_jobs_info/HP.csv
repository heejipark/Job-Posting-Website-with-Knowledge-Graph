Eagle Health is seeking Operations Specialists to join our team in support of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).*
Background and Objectives: The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Office of Security (SEC) is responsible for the protection of USAID personnel and critical assets through comprehensive and forward thinking security solutions that enable USAID to achieve its mission safely and securely.
The technical assistance articulated in this statement of work (SOW) is considered essential to ensure USAID employees who serve at USAID facilities worldwide are protected to the maximum extent feasible against the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). To provide the proper coordination and response to the COVID-19 pandemic, USAID Office of Security will be required to make adjustments as deemed necessary to the specifications and objectives of this contract.
The Office of Security (SEC) has the operational oversight of the USAID Command Center to include the administrative management of personnel that are detailed or temporarily assigned, and the administrative management of space and resource requirements.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on USAID highlighted the need to maintain a 24/7 operations center to monitor, notify, coordinate, and respond to issues impacting the USAID mission and staff. The USAID COVID 19 Task Force established a Command Center to monitor and coordinate issues impacting personnel, their travel, and USAID facilities on a 24/7 basis. This capability will continue to be required throughout the pandemic. Since the Task Force is a coordinating body, the Command Center transitioned to SEC to oversee its mission and responsibilities.
