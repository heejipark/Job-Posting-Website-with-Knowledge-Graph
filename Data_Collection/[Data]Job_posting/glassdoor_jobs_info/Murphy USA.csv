The Primary care physicians will be responsible for delivery of outpatient primary care to patients enrolled in STVHCS. The physician and Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) will manage a panel of patients. Panel size is determined by VHA guidelines which take into consideration the complexity of the patient panel, available support staff, number of treatment rooms, etc. Each provider's panel size is specific to their practice and setting.

The PACT Model is a patient-driven, team-based approach that delivers efficient, comprehensive and continuous care through active communication and coordination of healthcare services through an interdisciplinary team that includes the PCP, RN care manager, LVN, clerical associate as well as other clinical services necessary to meet the health goals and needs of the Veteran patient including specialists. While the primary care provider's relationship with the Veteran patient will remain key, that bond will be augmented and strengthened by involving other health care staff as part of an integrated team.

The Veteran patient, with support from other members of the team, becomes engaged in his or her health care, ensuring the health care system best serves his/her individual needs.
