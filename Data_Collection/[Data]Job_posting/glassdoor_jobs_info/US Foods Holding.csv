Job summary
The Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT) manages inventory under uncertainty of demand, pricing, promotions, supply, vendor lead times, and product life cycle. We optimize tradeoffs among customer promise, Fast Track in-stock, sourcing cost, transportation cost, holding cost, inventory obsolescence, FC capacity, and FC location. In addition, SCOT automates and optimizes Amazon's global supply chain for physical goods.

Automated Inventory Management (AIM): AIM’s primary objective is to maximize long-term free cash flow (LTFCF) improvements for Amazon by auditing SCOT systems and improving inventory outcomes. We drive improved supply chain outcomes through automated mechanisms and tools that inspect across the supply chain and identify defects and improvement opportunities. We are auditing the gap between successful team specific SCOT enterprise metrics and changes in desired business outcomes that are not necessarily defect based. We scale our defect repairs through fixing root causes with functional owners first and then moving to direct automated short-term repair where possible. Some defects may need an application change to be planned with the source team for the long-term repair, and in this instance, our automated repairs will provide interim support until the change is implemented.

Forecasting: Topline Forecasting enables and drives decision making on Amazon’s long-term business growth investment. We provide the aggregate forecasts, insights, and decision support products, in the form of automated solutions and strategic guidance. Topline Forecasting is used to drive hands-off-the-wheel financial planning and operations planning processes, producing long-term predictions of Prime membership, Prime Member Ordered Product Sales (PMOPS), ASIN selection, Average Selling Price (ASP), and ultimately shipped units and GMS at a daily grain over a five-year time horizon. Topline is a primary input into Consumer-wide OP1 and OP2 plans, the monthly/quarterly Finance R&O process, Consumer’s annual long-range plan (LRP), Operation’s medium and long-term topology and capacity planning, and Transportation planning. The forecast covers Retail, FBA, and Marketplace Fulfillment Network (MFN) channels across nine marketplaces, 60 unique product groups, 1000+ unique categories, and various segments related to Prime status (e.g., Free Trial versus Paid), customer tenure and B2B/B2C customers.

The ASIN Forecasting team produces ASIN-level probabilistic forecasts of unconstrained customer demand for up to 1 year in the future for 400M ASINs WW sold through the retail and FBA channel as well as stores such as Prime Now and Whole Foods. For a specific ASIN, start date and end date combination, a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of forecasted total demand units in that period is produced. Forecasts are produced at multiple region grains (country, zip2, stores and aggregation of countries). In addition to production forecasting models, the team owns the Forecasting Distribution Service (FDS), a Tier-1 service with a P90 SLA of 40 milliseconds, which can be called over 4 billion times on a single day. This service has over 50 unique customers, made up of various teams and business groups within and outside of SCOT such as Inventory Buying, Optimal Inventory Health, Inventory Placement, Selection Economics, FBA and S&OP. One of these customers, SCOT Continuous Buying, uses these forecasts to trigger the buys of over 4 billion units WW.

Fulfillment optimization: Fulfillment Optimization focuses on delivering items to customers quickly, efficiently, and reliably. We own a suite of Supply Chain products and services that forecast the need for transportation resources, optimize the network set-up/configuration, determine the operational capability (warehouse, fulfillment and transportation), map the inventory and transportation resource capacity/availability, and accordingly provide the best delivery promises to customers. Once the promises are made, we identify the cost optimal fulfillment plan and orchestrate the shipments making sure that the promises are met and CX is preserved.

Inventory planning and control: The Inventory Planning & Control group determines how much of a given product is needed at each location in our network in order to ensure product availability, while maintaining minimal inventory levels at each storage location. This includes strategically placing vendor orders and moving inventory between nodes of our network to serve customer demand at the lowest cost. The network topology plan will include locations for capabilities such as fulfillment, sortation, customer returns, inbound prep, cross dock, vendor flex and drop ship.

Optimal sourcing systems: Optimal Sourcing Systems (OSS) designs and builds systems that measure and manage Amazon’s supplier capabilities, identify and react to supply disruptions, and prioritizes inbound freight for our global network. OSS software is used by every country Amazon services, and is a critical link to ensuring Amazon offers the products our customers want, at the lowest possible cost.

SCOT science: SCOT Science provides the science behind SCOT systems. Our community is a diverse group of scientists spanning a wide range of disciplines (applied math, operations research, statistics, economics, computer science) and job families (data scientists, applied scientists, research scientists) - all working on the most complex challenges in supply chain optimization. We work closely with our SCOT cross-functional partners, collaborate with other scientist throughout Amazon and are actively engaged with the external scientific research community.

Job summary
The Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT) manages inventory under uncertainty of demand, pricing, promotions, supply, vendor lead times, and product life cycle. We optimize tradeoffs among customer promise, Fast Track in-stock, sourcing cost, transportation cost, holding cost, inventory obsolescence, FC capacity, and FC location. In addition, SCOT automates and optimizes Amazon's global supply chain for physical goods.

Automated Inventory Management (AIM): AIM’s primary objective is to maximize long-term free cash flow (LTFCF) improvements for Amazon by auditing SCOT systems and improving inventory outcomes. We drive improved supply chain outcomes through automated mechanisms and tools that inspect across the supply chain and identify defects and improvement opportunities. We are auditing the gap between successful team specific SCOT enterprise metrics and changes in desired business outcomes that are not necessarily defect based. We scale our defect repairs through fixing root causes with functional owners first and then moving to direct automated short-term repair where possible. Some defects may need an application change to be planned with the source team for the long-term repair, and in this instance, our automated repairs will provide interim support until the change is implemented.

Forecasting: Topline Forecasting enables and drives decision making on Amazon’s long-term business growth investment. We provide the aggregate forecasts, insights, and decision support products, in the form of automated solutions and strategic guidance. Topline Forecasting is used to drive hands-off-the-wheel financial planning and operations planning processes, producing long-term predictions of Prime membership, Prime Member Ordered Product Sales (PMOPS), ASIN selection, Average Selling Price (ASP), and ultimately shipped units and GMS at a daily grain over a five-year time horizon. Topline is a primary input into Consumer-wide OP1 and OP2 plans, the monthly/quarterly Finance R&O process, Consumer’s annual long-range plan (LRP), Operation’s medium and long-term topology and capacity planning, and Transportation planning. The forecast covers Retail, FBA, and Marketplace Fulfillment Network (MFN) channels across nine marketplaces, 60 unique product groups, 1000+ unique categories, and various segments related to Prime status (e.g., Free Trial versus Paid), customer tenure and B2B/B2C customers.

The ASIN Forecasting team produces ASIN-level probabilistic forecasts of unconstrained customer demand for up to 1 year in the future for 400M ASINs WW sold through the retail and FBA channel as well as stores such as Prime Now and Whole Foods. For a specific ASIN, start date and end date combination, a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of forecasted total demand units in that period is produced. Forecasts are produced at multiple region grains (country, zip2, stores and aggregation of countries). In addition to production forecasting models, the team owns the Forecasting Distribution Service (FDS), a Tier-1 service with a P90 SLA of 40 milliseconds, which can be called over 4 billion times on a single day. This service has over 50 unique customers, made up of various teams and business groups within and outside of SCOT such as Inventory Buying, Optimal Inventory Health, Inventory Placement, Selection Economics, FBA and S&OP. One of these customers, SCOT Continuous Buying, uses these forecasts to trigger the buys of over 4 billion units WW.

Fulfillment optimization: Fulfillment Optimization focuses on delivering items to customers quickly, efficiently, and reliably. We own a suite of Supply Chain products and services that forecast the need for transportation resources, optimize the network set-up/configuration, determine the operational capability (warehouse, fulfillment and transportation), map the inventory and transportation resource capacity/availability, and accordingly provide the best delivery promises to customers. Once the promises are made, we identify the cost optimal fulfillment plan and orchestrate the shipments making sure that the promises are met and CX is preserved.

Inventory planning and control: The Inventory Planning & Control group determines how much of a given product is needed at each location in our network in order to ensure product availability, while maintaining minimal inventory levels at each storage location. This includes strategically placing vendor orders and moving inventory between nodes of our network to serve customer demand at the lowest cost. The network topology plan will include locations for capabilities such as fulfillment, sortation, customer returns, inbound prep, cross dock, vendor flex and drop ship.

Optimal sourcing systems: Optimal Sourcing Systems (OSS) designs and builds systems that measure and manage Amazon’s supplier capabilities, identify and react to supply disruptions, and prioritizes inbound freight for our global network. OSS software is used by every country Amazon services, and is a critical link to ensuring Amazon offers the products our customers want, at the lowest possible cost.

SCOT science: SCOT Science provides the science behind SCOT systems. Our community is a diverse group of scientists spanning a wide range of disciplines (applied math, operations research, statistics, economics, computer science) and job families (data scientists, applied scientists, research scientists) - all working on the most complex challenges in supply chain optimization. We work closely with our SCOT cross-functional partners, collaborate with other scientist throughout Amazon and are actively engaged with the external scientific research community.

Job summary
The Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT) manages inventory under uncertainty of demand, pricing, promotions, supply, vendor lead times, and product life cycle. We optimize tradeoffs among customer promise, Fast Track in-stock, sourcing cost, transportation cost, holding cost, inventory obsolescence, FC capacity, and FC location. In addition, SCOT automates and optimizes Amazon's global supply chain for physical goods.

Automated Inventory Management (AIM): AIM’s primary objective is to maximize long-term free cash flow (LTFCF) improvements for Amazon by auditing SCOT systems and improving inventory outcomes. We drive improved supply chain outcomes through automated mechanisms and tools that inspect across the supply chain and identify defects and improvement opportunities. We are auditing the gap between successful team specific SCOT enterprise metrics and changes in desired business outcomes that are not necessarily defect based. We scale our defect repairs through fixing root causes with functional owners first and then moving to direct automated short-term repair where possible. Some defects may need an application change to be planned with the source team for the long-term repair, and in this instance, our automated repairs will provide interim support until the change is implemented.

Forecasting: Topline Forecasting enables and drives decision making on Amazon’s long-term business growth investment. We provide the aggregate forecasts, insights, and decision support products, in the form of automated solutions and strategic guidance. Topline Forecasting is used to drive hands-off-the-wheel financial planning and operations planning processes, producing long-term predictions of Prime membership, Prime Member Ordered Product Sales (PMOPS), ASIN selection, Average Selling Price (ASP), and ultimately shipped units and GMS at a daily grain over a five-year time horizon. Topline is a primary input into Consumer-wide OP1 and OP2 plans, the monthly/quarterly Finance R&O process, Consumer’s annual long-range plan (LRP), Operation’s medium and long-term topology and capacity planning, and Transportation planning. The forecast covers Retail, FBA, and Marketplace Fulfillment Network (MFN) channels across nine marketplaces, 60 unique product groups, 1000+ unique categories, and various segments related to Prime status (e.g., Free Trial versus Paid), customer tenure and B2B/B2C customers.

The ASIN Forecasting team produces ASIN-level probabilistic forecasts of unconstrained customer demand for up to 1 year in the future for 400M ASINs WW sold through the retail and FBA channel as well as stores such as Prime Now and Whole Foods. For a specific ASIN, start date and end date combination, a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of forecasted total demand units in that period is produced. Forecasts are produced at multiple region grains (country, zip2, stores and aggregation of countries). In addition to production forecasting models, the team owns the Forecasting Distribution Service (FDS), a Tier-1 service with a P90 SLA of 40 milliseconds, which can be called over 4 billion times on a single day. This service has over 50 unique customers, made up of various teams and business groups within and outside of SCOT such as Inventory Buying, Optimal Inventory Health, Inventory Placement, Selection Economics, FBA and S&OP. One of these customers, SCOT Continuous Buying, uses these forecasts to trigger the buys of over 4 billion units WW.

Fulfillment optimization: Fulfillment Optimization focuses on delivering items to customers quickly, efficiently, and reliably. We own a suite of Supply Chain products and services that forecast the need for transportation resources, optimize the network set-up/configuration, determine the operational capability (warehouse, fulfillment and transportation), map the inventory and transportation resource capacity/availability, and accordingly provide the best delivery promises to customers. Once the promises are made, we identify the cost optimal fulfillment plan and orchestrate the shipments making sure that the promises are met and CX is preserved.

Inventory planning and control: The Inventory Planning & Control group determines how much of a given product is needed at each location in our network in order to ensure product availability, while maintaining minimal inventory levels at each storage location. This includes strategically placing vendor orders and moving inventory between nodes of our network to serve customer demand at the lowest cost. The network topology plan will include locations for capabilities such as fulfillment, sortation, customer returns, inbound prep, cross dock, vendor flex and drop ship.

Optimal sourcing systems: Optimal Sourcing Systems (OSS) designs and builds systems that measure and manage Amazon’s supplier capabilities, identify and react to supply disruptions, and prioritizes inbound freight for our global network. OSS software is used by every country Amazon services, and is a critical link to ensuring Amazon offers the products our customers want, at the lowest possible cost.

SCOT science: SCOT Science provides the science behind SCOT systems. Our community is a diverse group of scientists spanning a wide range of disciplines (applied math, operations research, statistics, economics, computer science) and job families (data scientists, applied scientists, research scientists) - all working on the most complex challenges in supply chain optimization. We work closely with our SCOT cross-functional partners, collaborate with other scientist throughout Amazon and are actively engaged with the external scientific research community.

ABOUT BIOACTIVES
Bioactives are small molecule compounds produced by plants, fungi, and microbes that grow in and adapt to environments that present a wide range of challenges to their survival. Bioactives also benefit the health of humans – they are the enlivening caffeine in tea, the powerful antioxidant lycopene in tomatoes, and they inform active ingredients in medicines like Taxol, Aspirin and Metformin, a first-line treatment for Type 2 diabetes, derived from the French lilac flower. Science has long known that bioactives are critical to human health, yet the vast majority remain unknown and uncharted.

Job summary
The Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT) manages inventory under uncertainty of demand, pricing, promotions, supply, vendor lead times, and product life cycle. We optimize tradeoffs among customer promise, Fast Track in-stock, sourcing cost, transportation cost, holding cost, inventory obsolescence, FC capacity, and FC location. In addition, SCOT automates and optimizes Amazon's global supply chain for physical goods.

Automated Inventory Management (AIM): AIM’s primary objective is to maximize long-term free cash flow (LTFCF) improvements for Amazon by auditing SCOT systems and improving inventory outcomes. We drive improved supply chain outcomes through automated mechanisms and tools that inspect across the supply chain and identify defects and improvement opportunities. We are auditing the gap between successful team specific SCOT enterprise metrics and changes in desired business outcomes that are not necessarily defect based. We scale our defect repairs through fixing root causes with functional owners first and then moving to direct automated short-term repair where possible. Some defects may need an application change to be planned with the source team for the long-term repair, and in this instance, our automated repairs will provide interim support until the change is implemented.

Forecasting: Topline Forecasting enables and drives decision making on Amazon’s long-term business growth investment. We provide the aggregate forecasts, insights, and decision support products, in the form of automated solutions and strategic guidance. Topline Forecasting is used to drive hands-off-the-wheel financial planning and operations planning processes, producing long-term predictions of Prime membership, Prime Member Ordered Product Sales (PMOPS), ASIN selection, Average Selling Price (ASP), and ultimately shipped units and GMS at a daily grain over a five-year time horizon. Topline is a primary input into Consumer-wide OP1 and OP2 plans, the monthly/quarterly Finance R&O process, Consumer’s annual long-range plan (LRP), Operation’s medium and long-term topology and capacity planning, and Transportation planning. The forecast covers Retail, FBA, and Marketplace Fulfillment Network (MFN) channels across nine marketplaces, 60 unique product groups, 1000+ unique categories, and various segments related to Prime status (e.g., Free Trial versus Paid), customer tenure and B2B/B2C customers.

The ASIN Forecasting team produces ASIN-level probabilistic forecasts of unconstrained customer demand for up to 1 year in the future for 400M ASINs WW sold through the retail and FBA channel as well as stores such as Prime Now and Whole Foods. For a specific ASIN, start date and end date combination, a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of forecasted total demand units in that period is produced. Forecasts are produced at multiple region grains (country, zip2, stores and aggregation of countries). In addition to production forecasting models, the team owns the Forecasting Distribution Service (FDS), a Tier-1 service with a P90 SLA of 40 milliseconds, which can be called over 4 billion times on a single day. This service has over 50 unique customers, made up of various teams and business groups within and outside of SCOT such as Inventory Buying, Optimal Inventory Health, Inventory Placement, Selection Economics, FBA and S&OP. One of these customers, SCOT Continuous Buying, uses these forecasts to trigger the buys of over 4 billion units WW.

Fulfillment optimization: Fulfillment Optimization focuses on delivering items to customers quickly, efficiently, and reliably. We own a suite of Supply Chain products and services that forecast the need for transportation resources, optimize the network set-up/configuration, determine the operational capability (warehouse, fulfillment and transportation), map the inventory and transportation resource capacity/availability, and accordingly provide the best delivery promises to customers. Once the promises are made, we identify the cost optimal fulfillment plan and orchestrate the shipments making sure that the promises are met and CX is preserved.

Inventory planning and control: The Inventory Planning & Control group determines how much of a given product is needed at each location in our network in order to ensure product availability, while maintaining minimal inventory levels at each storage location. This includes strategically placing vendor orders and moving inventory between nodes of our network to serve customer demand at the lowest cost. The network topology plan will include locations for capabilities such as fulfillment, sortation, customer returns, inbound prep, cross dock, vendor flex and drop ship.

Optimal sourcing systems: Optimal Sourcing Systems (OSS) designs and builds systems that measure and manage Amazon’s supplier capabilities, identify and react to supply disruptions, and prioritizes inbound freight for our global network. OSS software is used by every country Amazon services, and is a critical link to ensuring Amazon offers the products our customers want, at the lowest possible cost.

SCOT science: SCOT Science provides the science behind SCOT systems. Our community is a diverse group of scientists spanning a wide range of disciplines (applied math, operations research, statistics, economics, computer science) and job families (data scientists, applied scientists, research scientists) - all working on the most complex challenges in supply chain optimization. We work closely with our SCOT cross-functional partners, collaborate with other scientist throughout Amazon and are actively engaged with the external scientific research community.

Job summary
The Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT) manages inventory under uncertainty of demand, pricing, promotions, supply, vendor lead times, and product life cycle. We optimize tradeoffs among customer promise, Fast Track in-stock, sourcing cost, transportation cost, holding cost, inventory obsolescence, FC capacity, and FC location. In addition, SCOT automates and optimizes Amazon's global supply chain for physical goods.

Automated Inventory Management (AIM): AIM’s primary objective is to maximize long-term free cash flow (LTFCF) improvements for Amazon by auditing SCOT systems and improving inventory outcomes. We drive improved supply chain outcomes through automated mechanisms and tools that inspect across the supply chain and identify defects and improvement opportunities. We are auditing the gap between successful team specific SCOT enterprise metrics and changes in desired business outcomes that are not necessarily defect based. We scale our defect repairs through fixing root causes with functional owners first and then moving to direct automated short-term repair where possible. Some defects may need an application change to be planned with the source team for the long-term repair, and in this instance, our automated repairs will provide interim support until the change is implemented.

Forecasting: Topline Forecasting enables and drives decision making on Amazon’s long-term business growth investment. We provide the aggregate forecasts, insights, and decision support products, in the form of automated solutions and strategic guidance. Topline Forecasting is used to drive hands-off-the-wheel financial planning and operations planning processes, producing long-term predictions of Prime membership, Prime Member Ordered Product Sales (PMOPS), ASIN selection, Average Selling Price (ASP), and ultimately shipped units and GMS at a daily grain over a five-year time horizon. Topline is a primary input into Consumer-wide OP1 and OP2 plans, the monthly/quarterly Finance R&O process, Consumer’s annual long-range plan (LRP), Operation’s medium and long-term topology and capacity planning, and Transportation planning. The forecast covers Retail, FBA, and Marketplace Fulfillment Network (MFN) channels across nine marketplaces, 60 unique product groups, 1000+ unique categories, and various segments related to Prime status (e.g., Free Trial versus Paid), customer tenure and B2B/B2C customers.

The ASIN Forecasting team produces ASIN-level probabilistic forecasts of unconstrained customer demand for up to 1 year in the future for 400M ASINs WW sold through the retail and FBA channel as well as stores such as Prime Now and Whole Foods. For a specific ASIN, start date and end date combination, a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of forecasted total demand units in that period is produced. Forecasts are produced at multiple region grains (country, zip2, stores and aggregation of countries). In addition to production forecasting models, the team owns the Forecasting Distribution Service (FDS), a Tier-1 service with a P90 SLA of 40 milliseconds, which can be called over 4 billion times on a single day. This service has over 50 unique customers, made up of various teams and business groups within and outside of SCOT such as Inventory Buying, Optimal Inventory Health, Inventory Placement, Selection Economics, FBA and S&OP. One of these customers, SCOT Continuous Buying, uses these forecasts to trigger the buys of over 4 billion units WW.

Fulfillment optimization: Fulfillment Optimization focuses on delivering items to customers quickly, efficiently, and reliably. We own a suite of Supply Chain products and services that forecast the need for transportation resources, optimize the network set-up/configuration, determine the operational capability (warehouse, fulfillment and transportation), map the inventory and transportation resource capacity/availability, and accordingly provide the best delivery promises to customers. Once the promises are made, we identify the cost optimal fulfillment plan and orchestrate the shipments making sure that the promises are met and CX is preserved.

Inventory planning and control: The Inventory Planning & Control group determines how much of a given product is needed at each location in our network in order to ensure product availability, while maintaining minimal inventory levels at each storage location. This includes strategically placing vendor orders and moving inventory between nodes of our network to serve customer demand at the lowest cost. The network topology plan will include locations for capabilities such as fulfillment, sortation, customer returns, inbound prep, cross dock, vendor flex and drop ship.

Optimal sourcing systems: Optimal Sourcing Systems (OSS) designs and builds systems that measure and manage Amazon’s supplier capabilities, identify and react to supply disruptions, and prioritizes inbound freight for our global network. OSS software is used by every country Amazon services, and is a critical link to ensuring Amazon offers the products our customers want, at the lowest possible cost.

SCOT science: SCOT Science provides the science behind SCOT systems. Our community is a diverse group of scientists spanning a wide range of disciplines (applied math, operations research, statistics, economics, computer science) and job families (data scientists, applied scientists, research scientists) - all working on the most complex challenges in supply chain optimization. We work closely with our SCOT cross-functional partners, collaborate with other scientist throughout Amazon and are actively engaged with the external scientific research community.

· 3+ years’ full-time experience in software design and development. · 2+ years’ experience as a lead developer on at least one project. · 2+ years’ experience mentoring and coaching others. · Experience with distributed systems, relational databases, map-reduce solutions. · Ability to effectively articulate technical challenges and solutions to non-technical audiences.
