Do you find yourself constantly looking for more and better information? Do you want a job where you can use your knowledge and research skills to improve national security? Never has the role of an All-Source Analyst been so meaningful. More connected devices, larger storage capacity, and faster connections have resulted in an explosion of available information. The problem facing the intelligence community is no longer how to get more data – it's understanding how to turn the data they have into answers. That’s where you come in. With critical thinking and flexibility, you quickly seek out the accurate data sources, sift through the raw data and turn it into valuable intelligence. If you have strong analytical skills and a problem-solving mindset, we have an opportunity to use those skills to protect our national security.
As an Intelligence analyst on our team, you’ll explore new data sources, create effective narratives, and combine information from disparate sources to help your client understand their mission environment. You’ll learn how to validate the information and apply client tradecraft as you help build assessments for senior policymakers. This is a chance to grow your expertise in researching, drafting, and publishing time-sensitive assessments. You’ll develop new skills in evaluating entities suspected of targeting US interests and proprietary technology and evaluate foreign threats. We focus on growing as a team to deliver the best support to our customers, so you’ll have resources for mentoring and learning new skills and tools. Join us as we provide the right information at the right time to support the critical needs of our policymakers.

"['Pew Charitable Trusts', '3.5']",https://www.pewtrusts.org/,Event Management System Specialist,"Memphis, TN",$30K - $37K (Employer est.),"The Environment Portfolio at The Pew Charitable Trusts

For more than 30 years, Pew has been a major force in engaging the public and policy makers about the causes, consequences, and solutions to some of the world's most pressing environmental challenges. Our environment work spans all seven continents with more than 250 professionals working at the local, national, and international levels to reduce the scope and severity of global environmental problems, such as the erosion of large natural ecosystems that contain a great part of the world's remaining biodiversity, and the destruction of the marine environment. Pew's global environmental program focuses on science-based, nonpartisan, and sustainable solutions to help protect the planet and people. We work in partnership with governments, Indigenous rights holders, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, local stakeholders, scientists, and other researchers to advance public policy so that nature and communities can thrive.

Since 1990, Pew has worked in North America, South America and Australia to protect large and critically important terrestrial ecosystems, including rivers and other freshwater resources, coastal temperate rainforests, interior mountain ranges, the northern boreal forests, Australia's Outback, and Chilean Patagonia. We work to ensure these natural systems remain bountiful, functioning, and resilient, providing essential ecological services such as clean air and clean water, sustenance and food security for local communities and more broadly for the welfare of current and future generations. Our work relies on the sciences of conservation, sociology, biology, and economics to advocate for practical and durable solutions to the loss of biodiversity.

In the sea, reforms to how our oceans are managed are essential to address overfishing, pollution, and loss of habitat. Pew began its oceans program in the United States, focusing on ending overfishing and protecting fragile marine habitat. Starting in 2005, Pew's ocean conservation program expanded around the world and played a significant role in reforming marine fisheries management in the European Union and on the high seas and creating large scale marine reserves around the world. Our work is grounded in the best available science and pursues domestic and international conservation measures that are long-term and provide permanent, durable protections for marine ecosystems. We also work to address systemic threats to the ocean, including from plastics, over-and-illegal fishing, seabed mining, and climate change.



Conservation Support works across Pew's environment portfolio to ensure development of robust policy positions and strategy, provide specialized expertise, assist in developing and launching of new bodies of work, and provide for internal and external coordination, including coordinating Pew efforts around major international meetings.

Conservation Support is an integral part of the broader environment team, which currently focuses on establishing and improving marine protected areas; protecting ocean life on the high seas and in the deep sea; improving fisheries management, ending illegal fishing, and reducing harmful fisheries subsidies; preventing ocean plastics; protecting coastal habitats; and protecting Chilean Patagonia and Australia's Outback and oceans.


The Senior Officer, Conservation Support is a cross-cutting role that will serve as a resource on conservation finance issues across Pew's environment portfolio. They will deploy their knowledge and understanding of a variety of conservation finance approaches and their experience of developing and securing conservation financing deals to negotiate innovative financial solutions with an array of potential partners, investors, and other funding sources. This is a new position which will build Pew's capacity on conservation finance as these initiatives grow in importance.

Initial focus will be in two areas: Enduring Earth, an ambitious collaboration between The Nature Conservancy, The Pew Charitable Trusts, World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and ZOMALAB to refine and apply the Project Finance for Permanence (PFP) model to ensure durable and scalable conservation outcomes around the world; and Pew's work in securing financing streams to support coastal wetlands protection, management, and restoration in multiple countries.

The Senior Officer will report to the Project Director, Conservation Support, who is based in the Washington, DC office. This position is eligible for up to 60% telework.











Domestic and international travel expected approximately 20% of the time.



We offer a competitive salary and benefit program, including: comprehensive, affordable health care through medical, dental, and vision coverage; financial security with life and disability insurance; opportunities to save using health savings and flexible spending accounts; retirement benefits to help prepare for the future; and work/life benefits to maintain a good balance.

Do you find yourself constantly looking for more and better information? Do you want a job where you can use your knowledge and research skills to improve national security? Never has the role of an All-Source Analyst been so meaningful. More connected devices, larger storage capacity, and faster connections have resulted in an explosion of available information. The problem facing the intelligence community is no longer how to get more data – it's understanding how to turn the data they have into answers. That’s where you come in. With critical thinking and flexibility, you quickly seek out the accurate data sources, sift through the raw data and turn it into valuable intelligence. If you have strong analytical skills and a problem-solving mindset, we have an opportunity to use those skills to protect our national security.
As an Intelligence analyst on our team, you’ll explore new data sources, create effective narratives, and combine information from disparate sources to help your client understand their mission environment. You’ll learn how to validate the information and apply client tradecraft as you help build assessments for senior policymakers. This is a chance to grow your expertise in researching, drafting, and publishing time-sensitive assessments. You’ll develop new skills in evaluating entities suspected of targeting US interests and proprietary technology and evaluate foreign threats. We focus on growing as a team to deliver the best support to our customers, so you’ll have resources for mentoring and learning new skills and tools. Join us as we provide the right information at the right time to support the critical needs of our policymakers.
